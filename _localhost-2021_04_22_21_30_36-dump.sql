However, it lets itself down in a number of ways. First, the graphics aren\'t antialiased very well, leaving a bit of a grainy look to almost everything in the game. Second, they have given a lot of touchscreen control now, but they forgot to make everything just as easy to use _without_ the stylus. Third, and perhaps the most annoying thing, is that they hired some 25 year old actor to play both MegaMan.exe and Lan. Now, we all know Lan is around 11 years old, and MegaMan.exe (formerly RockMan.exe) is around the same age, as the storyline from the earlier games tells us that he is Lan\'s brother, Hal. Under these circumstances, hiring old actors to voice kids is completely unforgivable, and a mistake which the Japanese version did not make. Luckily the gameplay is so good that I\'m still willing to press on even though every bit of voice in the game makes me cringe, so this still gets a 7 in my books.','TrejkazX.','a73d785c3ebb80ce07d78005ef541bd99b66e8e7edf32c9459ee3dc2113c6750'),(435411,'user',8,'Dec 19, 2005','This game is great, we even get to use Colonel and Protoman.

Exploring the faithfully-recreated locales is quite the experience for any SpongeBob fan, and the beautiful presentation and original voice actors ensure you remain immersed. It’s unfortunate that the gameplay remains as simple as it was in 2003 and that the new multiplayer mode lacks any of the charms of the campaign. There’s little new for returning players to sink their teeth into, and if you’re not already a fan, not a lot of depth to keep you engaged.

The combat is fun and requires skill to defeat the harder gladiators. recommended','CaptainObvious','9d8889efa346c6df86e4e67f6706739024d319cd34bb3b73645e059643beb280'),(435682,'user',0,'Nov 17, 2017','How our government works simulator.

The campaign was just over 4 hours long and ends openly. Gone are the days of buying a complete game at launch. While the campaign was enjoyable it didn\'t do anything new or shocking  and you see everything coming a mile away. The progression system is beyond broken in this game! You use credits earned by playing to buy Heroes (Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, ect) however you also use these same credits to buy loot boxes that randomly give you cards to upgrade the normal class characters. So if you want to play as Darth Vader and you are currently saving all your credits for him that means you are not able to upgrade any of your other characters. They have since lowered the insane prices of Heroes, however they also lowered your rewards for completing the campaign, and also limited the amount of credits you can earn in arcade mode. Yes you heard it correctly, they limit the amount of progression you can EARN in the game by PLAYING the game to cause you to pull out your wallet and buy your way to top of progression. Another note to end on your performance does not matter in this game. If you have 0 kills 50 deaths and do not play the objectives you earn the same amount of credits at the end of the match as the guy who gets 50 kills, a 45 kill streak, and only 1 death. The game is BROKEN.','Slicksnoopy','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(435687,'user',0,'Nov 17, 2017','dishonest business practices with crappy pay to win tactics on a 60 dollar game.  score absolute ZERO.

Vehicles are clunky and options to destroy enemies vehicle spawns are non-existent compared to previous games. Hero selection is very limited. Progression is waaaaay too slow in multiplayer, and the microtransactions make progression even worse; this is compounded by the fact that you get useless emotes in the same packs you get actual upgrades from, making unlocking star cards for units you actually want to use even more difficult. Given the game\'s monetization model and progression stopping loot box system at the center of the game, 3/10 is being generous (and that\'s mostly for the visuals and immersion). If loot boxes are removed and replaced with a better progression system (that is not RNG-based and unrewarding)  I could still only see the game getting a 7/10 due to limited gameplay options and removal of past title\'s innovative tactics.','GideonGG','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(435710,'user',3,'Nov 18, 2017','Graphics, combat systems and everything else is greatly improved, but still, we have lootboxes, in-game money transactions after we paid for the game.

At least on the xbox version, glitches are common, one particular prevents me from saving the game. Meaning I made it to the 2nd boss in one session and trying to get back in the game lead to a reset to Jellyfish Fields. Another problem is the new enemy design, some enemies are harder, and not for fair reasons. I think the most atrocious is the tar tar launcher, in which there is no hit stun after hitting him the first time. So if you try to go in for a second hit, you\'ll immediately be hit again with no warning. The hoard mode is also disappointing because you can only play it with another person. Meaning if you dont own an online subscription you\'re locked out of this content without a friend, which seems like a bad design choice. Overall the game seems rushed and holds a lack of polish, including the new movement where it\'s a lot less fast paced than the original. So that\'s a disappointment. Some positives are the amazing artstyle, and new tracks. While there isnt much to say since they are straightforwar, they definitely boost this game up.

If there’s any criticism i have it’s that some of the areas seem to have this yellow glow everywhere that looks really off and some of the game physics like sandy’s rope swinging and throwing objects where a bit less fun, and speaking of less fun the game had a serious downgrade in difficulty to a game that was relatively easy, for example the final mission in the game that was supposed to be the most difficult part of the game got checkpoints added to every platform, and some of the bosses where also toned down. Oh and also some animations are really stiff specially in the boss fights. Still nothing that makes the game bad, I would even say that all of my criticism was personal and doesn’t affect most of the players.

Thats a clear massage: Start as soon as we release overpriced, overhyped game or grind for weeks as an underdog and get owned by people who not only knows maps and mechanics better but also outgear you and outlevel your abilities... I was full of optimism when i started multiplayer, but its unbrearable, unfun experience. Constantly being owned by enemies who happens to always have topped deck. After few days i give up. The leveling of stuff is to slow and 99,9% people that kill me shows max levels.

I understand that it is a progression type game, but progressing is hard to darn near impossible to earn battle points. Also you will need in game money when going up against a team that has pretty much maxed out their abilities. To be able to achieve weapon and class  milestones to progress an to be reward with in game money so you can buy class and hero crates . Of course the reason for this is that the game was designed from the ground up with MTX in mind to entice people to spend money for in game currency so they can apply it to their character builds.Also matches are starting without filling both teams to 20 players each. And playing 17v10 for a couple of mins is not fun. And for a game that focuses on the multiplayer aspect more so that story telling rpg side  it really isn\'t worth it because of  those glaring faults.

Your characters join the rebellion within the first few missions, so this idea of it being an Empire campaign is a joke.

Jokes about the lower internet, 12/10, banana is right, bought myself and sister, bible references, glory to Ukraine and others are local memes too. Don\'t take them seriosly. I\'m also going to put a 10 despite I didn\'t even buy the game and I\'m not going to. Because this is how metacritic works. It\'s a public opinion agregator, not a fair review agregator.','kurzawhile','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(436146,'user',10,'Jun 23, 2020','Игра - шедевар, так Itpedia сказал','ImRussian','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(436147,'user',10,'Jun 24, 2020','Game, feels how I remember with a great appearance.

Unfortunately, this attempt failed miserably. Not only was it mired in controversy, but the core mechanics and gameplay are lackluster and leave much to be desired. Melee heroes are difficult and unwieldy with their forced movement animations, gunplay is often interrupted because of the recharging weapon system instead of conventional ammo, battles are most often confined and formulaic with a few strategies leading to victory each time. The classes still do not reflect the classic battlefront feel and are largely unbalanced with certain classes being rendered obsolete on certain maps while others are nearly unstoppable. Heroes too are unbalanced as some heroes have a plethora of ranged abilities that prevent enemies from getting close enough to attack effectively, whereas others have abilities that are largely useless in most situations. Map design is uninspired and even inaccurate at times with the majority of maps being three-lane just like Call of Duty\'s maps. This leaves little room for creativity and style and forces a type of gameplay that often makes multiplayer boring and repetitive. Star cards are an interesting concept and might have been something good in this mess of a game, unfortunately, the star card system was poorly implemented and is largely centered around small boosts to certain abilities or the replacement of old abilities with new ones. This would have been an excellent idea if the player was not limited to three star cards and ability replacement cards did not count towards this total. In that way, the player would have much more freedom to tailor their experience and play style to their liking which would create new and interesting ways of fighting. Some classes and heroes have appearances which can be unlocked with in game currency earned through leveling up and completing milestones. Through milestones, players can also unlock new weapons for each of the four main classes. These weapons allow for some customization and variation, though not by much seeing as it takes just as long to kill an enemy with a rapid-fire weapon as it does with a triple-burst or single-fire. Sadly, the other two classes have no or very little choices for appearances and no weapon choices. This makes two out of the six classes seem disjointed, not to mention each special class is greatly varied which makes playing different factions a unique experience, but also makes for a sharp learning curve. The Campaign is bare bones and poorly written with predictable stories around every corner and a meaningless narrative that was never actually finished. Overall, this game is fun if you like Star Wars, multiplayer, and maybe a bit of customization, but if you can\'t overlook its plethora of flaws, you might want to give this one a pass.','Honesty_is_Best','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(436355,'user',10,'Jun 23, 2020','Знаете, я никогда не думал, что столкнусь со столь шедевральной игрой как эта.','Vladbohatk0','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(436356,'user',10,'Jun 23, 2020','Игра просто восхитительная!

It also is quite sensitive to your movement, but there is little warning to what is coming up. There are lots of songs at a variety of difficulty levels.

After playing for about 30 minutes, my expectations had already been exceeded, and I was hooked. The player gets to choose from a generous lineup of classic and more recent Michael Jackson songs which are all available from the onset. I\'m sure fanatics could point out some shortcomings in the set list, but as a moderate Jackson fan, all of the songs I expected and wanted to see included were present. Furthermore, it included Dirty Diana, which is my favorite Michael Jackson song! The objective of the game is simple: Score the highest amount of points possible by attempting to mimic the movements of Michael or other on screen dancers for the duration of a song which feature backdrops that compliment the music.  It sounds easy enough, but if you don\'t already know, Michael, nor his crew were slouches when it came to dance moves. You\'ll be very, very hard-pressed to achieve a perfect 5 star rating on even the easiest of songs.  The Wii only (sometimes questionably) monitors the movement of the remote which is in your hand, so theoretically you can just watch the prompts and \'cheat\' your way through a song by just moving your hand if you really want to.  But if you\'re actually trying to duplicate Michael\'s dance moves, it\'s rather challenging, even after you\'ve began to memorize some of the routines.  Although, I\'ve only played it as a single player game, it supports 2-4 players simultaneously, which would be great for parties. There is no career mode or many extra features, it\'s just straightforward dancing.  But as I stated earlier, I bought it primarily for a fun exercise experience, and on that front, it\'s a perfect  10.  It makes for a very entertaining, and demanding 30 minute workout.  Micheal Jackson is the King of Pop for a reason. He had insanely catchy tunes, and innovative dance routines that no other artist could match. The game isn\'t incredibly robust outside of the actual dancing, and could have easily included more features to round out the experience, but for $15, you could do much, much worse.','akus_1985','5a24c930b05bde2d54511322e8acd83ecddc04bd3124bd9e54e044de4a1de110'),(436839,'user',10,'Jun 24, 2020','월요일 좋아! 원작팬이라면 강추합니다.','takoside','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(436840,'user',7,'Jun 24, 2020','Mr. Krabs’s voice acting is terrible.

This game can not be rated fairly because it will ruin not just your image of EA and DICE but it will damage your overall love for STAR WARS games and movies. Besides these the hero characters looks like they are on drugs, some of the voice actors are horrible too.  And on the top of it they want REAL MONEY FOR THIS GARBAGE!!! Beware this game is already dead, there are hours in a day when You won\'t find 40ppl matches. And the actual content in the game is like half of the previous one which is also a dead and mediocre game in general. If it wasn\'t a licensed star wars game even the fake press would not care about it but they are paid heavily so they gave ACTUALLY GOOD REVIEWS OF THIS WORTHLESS mess of redundant code pile. This was my worst decision ever to buy this game even on half the retail price and I did some messed up stuff, believe me.','R3app3r','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(436891,'user',0,'Nov 18, 2017','Gambling for kids?

The makes it truly tragic that the advancement system is so badly done. Unlike in older Battlefront and Battlefield games, advancement is locked behind a random unlock system. You are forced to to play the lottery with your credits to advance classes. These same credits are also the same currency used to unlock heroes. You are forced to choose between unlocking heroes or advancing your classes. The cost of crates are also high. The crate that contains the card you would use the most is the Trooper crate and cost 4000 credits only 1000 credits short of the cheapest heroes.  You earn credits at a rate of 200-300 a match. When you first start the rate of credits seems fine because of challenges, but they will run dry long before you can afford to unlock everything. That combined with the random nature of the unlock system means you can be suck without being able to upgrade the class you want for quite a long time. These unlocks matter because they represent real power increases because they improve cool downs and damage on abilities.

Better than battlefield 1 COD ww ll and Destiny ll which are its real competitors. I am not paid or part of EA or others.  Stop that redicoulous whining about the looting system. You get a free loote crate every day you log in AND you can earn them too, so whats the problem?? Furthermore you have to earn place for starcards by fightning, so you can not just buy. Whats the problem?? Do you have an idea of the costs od developing high quality games?? Should we go back to 1930 cartoon style graphics and pacman?? Do you know how many high quality playing hours you get for 60 dollars only?? What we risk here cause of all you whiners is that they begin to think that ok, they dont want to pay what it costs, we reduce the content and quality!! - In the beginning you can b beaten by the players that has more upgraded guns and abilities, but that will eventually level out after not so long. The campain is 100% the best and most varied singleplayer out there, very catching and with amazing graphic as is the multiplayer. The starcards you earn - AND get for free every day!! - is a genius way of making your playing personal suited for your style. Amazing atmosphere, tons of things to do, fantastic sound.

You usually NEVER get on a decent team because all the openings are on the **** teams where people have already rage quit and you take their place on the shyte team. So much fun... When you finally get on a good team and are able to get some points, after about 3 rounds it becomes stupid boring and you can literally just sit around and goof off.. which is fun sometimes I won\'t lie. Essentially either I find myself rage quitting from impossible situations or bored out of my mind due to other team being full of completely terrible players.

Combat is as great as Playstation era and as far as I have seen, the only two issues I have are that some characters do not have same voice actor which isn\'t a big deal, but it still sounds weird, and the fact that between respawns after dying or falling in goo, the loading screen to return to the game takes longer than it should, which isn\'t a big deal either, but it\'s always good to leave information.

Players of the deluxe edition or early access were free to spend as much real money as they wanted/could afford to gain an obvious competitive advantage over other players; in a AAA title multiplayer game, that is downright destructive to the game and community.

EA/DICE have adopted a technique to bilk consumers out of hard earned money simply by using algorithms to purposely unbalance each and every multiplayer match. this exact strategy is used in battlefield as well, neither game uses \"matchmaking\", wihch USED to put players in games with other players of similar rank/skill. DICE/EA use this to UNBALANCE every game played to ensure maximum potential microtransactions. neither of these games EVER put players on an even playing field, there are always players with much more health, and much stronger fire power, and to really pound it home and punish these NEW players, the opposition uses tech like thermal vision, target acquisition etc. its not fun to be on either end of this **** completely decimating the other team over and over is BORINGGG, and getting raped again and again by guys who can head-shot you from across the entire map is annoying. every single match there are guys on each team that get 80 kills each when the server average is less than 10. its brilliant from a business standpoint,  get kids mad enough, they will pay to get better gear and not be dominated unfairly. on top of all this, JUST LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR, SWBF2  is in no way an \"FPS\", everyone stays in third person and hides behind walls peeking over waiting for some sucker to walk by then BAM pop out and execute...THIS IS THE ENTIRE GAME NOW, its not competitive whatsoever..it is not fun at all! i hope EA/DICE lose their license agreement with star wars, they do not deserve it.

First of all the most glaring example, units are too strong. Every fight lasts minutes because units have so much health and so little damage. Superweapons are a mere support power, in fact the only super weapon that is powerful is the Novus Gravity Bomb, a black-hole type power that sucks all units into it. Oh, and it deals more damage than almost anything else. Another issue is the fact that two of the three factions are considerably more useful than the third. The 1st faction, Hierarchy, who is based around steamrolling, yet have the best scout (Monolith) and the have the ability to see the entire map at once. They are also the only faction to have an artillery unit, who is also debatable the most powerful Hero unit in the game. They also have structures who double as what is essentially an Epic/Super unit. The 2nd faction, Novus, is a swarming faction who also has the only notable Air units. The Dervish is a fast fighter that also has the ability to shoot lightning in every direction and kill just about anything. They are also supported by Vertigo, the only Air Hero. Vertigo is stealthed, fast, and has a deadly Railgun. The Novus also have Mirabel, who has more offensive capability than any other Novus unit. She has a powerful burst-fire Railgun, shoulder launched anti-ground missiles, and the ability to snipe a target from long distances. This Sniper ability is the only weapon that can instant kill another unit besides Superpowers. The final faction, the Masari, are supposedly Gods, yet are horribly outmatched. They supposedly are the turtling faction, yet the Novus have the only turret that can hit air and ground. The Novus turret also redirects enemy fire and increases in damage as more of them are made. The Hierarchy has an anti-ground turret that can mutate infantry into zombies and hold most vehicles at bay. The Hierarchy Anti-air turret can pull air units to the ground while it kills them when upgraded. The Air units cannot escape. Even Vertigo is not immune. The Hierarchy also has a stealth hero who can pull air units down, and then turn invincible as he drains their health. He can also drain vehicles health while invincible.

There are flaws though like the progression system, which isnt even that bad, and the game needs a bit more balancing. i have noticed a few bugs here and there but none of them have been game breaking, and these problems can be addressed in a future patch. Yes there are loot boxes but they can be earned pretty quickly and Dice has already made a lot of improvements to them since the beta. Besides that this game is really good. I have already put over 24 hours in and I am having a lot of fun. The game play is really good and the graphics are really high quality. The story line is a lot of fun and is a great addition to the Star Wars cannon. There is also already a lot more content then there was in the first battlefront and the DLC is free. If you are a Star Wars fan there is a high chance you will enjoy this title. i just wanted to give an honest review before all the review bomb 0\'s start popping up.  I get that micro-transactions are a bad practice and shouldn\'t be in video games, but to review bomb because of it isn\'t a good practice either. All it\'s going to do is make people not be able to trust reviews. There are better ways to show EA that the loot box system needs to be removed from games. Remember most games that have loot boxes for sale are still charging for DLC. This game is at least giving all the DLC for free. Almost all of the stuff you get from loot boxes is also locked behind progression, even star card levels are directly tied to in game progression. You can\'t spend money to max out your character. Also as of now they completely removed the micro-transactions. I also don\'t understand why people are saying its gonna take forever to get all the characters, i have them all and i got them in less than 10 hours, and no i didn\'t buy any loot boxes. It\'s like these people are basing their reviews off the beta. The game has changed so much sense then.','TheValeyards','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437225,'user',10,'Jun 24, 2020','Game of the year!

Instead you have these annoying missions in the middle that cant decide what type of game they want to be. I still play Battlefield 4, such an amazing game, then EA take that engine and turn it into a Star Wars game, and a bad one at that. The multiplayer is terrible also, so im not bothered about the microtransactions as will never play it. Would grab it on sale on Origin, but never buy it fill price as the only decent thing about it is the Starship battles and the rest is just Meh!','Mitsie','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437334,'user',7,'Jul 28, 2020','This game is a generic multiplayer shooter , with working single player,  which I would give 7/10; and was enjoyable.','cmfrip','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437335,'user',10,'Jun 24, 2020','I think it is a good game.

I got no complaints about that because I loved the original as a kid and loved replaying it as an adult. It\'s a perfectly fun, wonderfully nostalgic trip. Furthermore, it opens up this generation of children to an awesome game based on a great cartoon series. If I had any criticism, I would say it was a little too buggy.

Multiplayer at times feels unbalanced, then at other times you are doing very well, aside from the guy on the top of the leader board that seems to have a spammy level of kills....All in all I like it, will keep playing and hope more people join online, it isn\'t a counterstike experience with super fast spawns but it isn\'t anywhere near Battle Field V, where you die so fast and wait forever only to have to pick who to spawn on each time, or run ALLLLLL the way across the map again for an objective, at least in this game it seems to be 75% faster gameplay overall. To end it, I wish titles like this learned from games like Counter Strike and the success it has, because what people want is not super realism in mechanics and being able to customize all the time, they want environments that are small scale, fast, even if you do have a large map, it should be simple....left and right side of map, try to push one side or the other, or simply team slayer overall, game companies are missing the mark generally by trying to provide what people hate, the same way Halo MCC for PC ruined matchmaking by removing custom server choices, where if you want you can play the same map over and over and over again....that\'s why on steam their player base is non existent.','T-Babyboi','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437449,'user',0,'Oct 26, 2020','Because of stupid Kamino 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0','SFroLtoad','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437450,'user',10,'Jun 24, 2020','Гениальная игра от гениальных разработчиков, наконец-то годный платформер, с хорошим сюжетом, Геймплеем и графикой, Спанч боб не гей кстати','Acegunne','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(437451,'user',10,'Jun 28, 2020','Офигенная игра!!!

I had to make a Meta Critic account just to support the true value this game still has, since most people. Now that the P2W system is gone for sometime, The game has opened up many opportunities. However, I had to give the honest 9/10 rating, because EA is still a horrible company that ruins great games. They ruined this Battlefront 2 beyond repair, because they thought that massive paywalls and micro transactions would be accepted by the community like the dumb people they are. However, grinding has been proved to be much easier, as unlike the original 40 hours, it now only takes 4 hours to unlock Vader and Luke, and less for the others, and grinding is no longer as hard. However, the prices of the loot boxes, the amount of credits gifted by matches still need to increase, for people should not need to spend any more than 2 hours unlocking their favorite heroes. Shooter experience needs to be revamped to match that of iconic shooters such as CoD and Battlefield. But of course. EA will never listen to us. They will continue to release more good games like this then completely screw them up with stuff like micro transactions. This game had potential to outdo all the previous battlefronts. EA had that chance, and screwed it up. Still buy the game, as most of the negative ratings are still based off of the micro transactions and paywalls, which have been removed, and since unlocking heroes takes only 4 hours instead of 40, this game has become much more bearable for me.','ShadowJediTank','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437507,'user',8,'Nov 20, 2017','The graphics are lovely.

With Battlefield-like gameplay, you can run into battle as a clone, battle droid, rebel, or stormtrooper. With vehicles as seen on TV, the game does a good job of balancing planes and tanks versus the infantry. There\'s four unique classes, guns that feel distinct, and many recognizable maps from the Star Wars movies. Despite Battlefront 2’s glaring loot box problem on release, the game rebounded to become one of the best shooters in recent years. Although the singleplayer wasn’t what fans expected or wanted, the multiplayer easily made up for it. Although support has stopped in 2020, the amount of content was more than enough to have fun in Battlefront 2 in 2020. Many of the problems in Battlefront 2015, such as DLC locked behind a paywall, and annoying hero systems were solved in the new Battlefront. Something that was for sure not a problem in Battlefront 2015 was the maps, which continue to be good in Battlefront 2. The maps are all visually stunning, as expected from any EA game. Unlike a lot of EA games however, the content actually lives up to expectations. One of the most important additions to Battlefront 2 was the fact that the developers listened to what the players really wanted, including new blasters when fresh ones hadn’t been added since launch. Even though lightsaber combat feels a bit weird, the points system to unlock vehicles and heroes is much better than the hero token system of the 2015 version. Heroes and vehicles also manage to balance fun for the hero and the infantry they’re facing, and not upsetting either side of the argument.','GlocktorSeuss','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437544,'user',10,'Jul 13, 2020','İlk çıktığında oldukça problemi olan oyun daha satın alalı 2 gün oldu gerçekten her kuruşunu değiyor bence zengin içerik ve star wars teması mükemmel olmuş oyun düzelmiş bence herkes alabilir','Revan2699','ceb7da5eb6734640fa3df37388da0a6fb04245561433fd1948a457cfb586cc6f'),(437545,'user',10,'Jun 28, 2020','Это удивительная игра с захватующим сюжетом , явно видны одголоски  современного общества .

There is a ton of **** loot boxes and THEY STILL HAVEN\'T REMOVED THEM like what the actual **** is wrong with EA. Anyways the gameplay is very good the graphics are good some stuttering goes on sometimes (I have an RTX 2060 btw) so they should probably make some performance updates if they can. I don\'t know what was going through Disney\'s tiny little **** mouse brain when they signed the rights to Star wars away like the devs from star wars battlefront 2 classics were making The 3RD GAME and then they just signed the rights away like bruh how **** mental are you. The first 2 games from the battlefront series were great even in 2020 there still great and the game out in the mid-2000s. When star wars battlefront 1 and 2 came out they had less **** content than a game made in **** 2005 like bruh. Honestly, Disney should just give the rights to star wars to the same devs that made star wars battlefront 1 and 2 classics.

In fact, with just how simple the economy system is, you get a lot of time to experiment with unit mixes, formations and literally leading massive armies against eachother.  Its even thrilling at times, aside from the occasional glitches, the sound design is great.  Hearing my Cavalry dash towards the unsuspecting group of Swordsmen is actually exciting, and the actual combat works as intended as well.  Units do counter units, you can\'t just build archers and beat the A.I.- they\'ll get pummeled by everything else on the battlefield.  The last minute, HEROES are not as obnoxious as some reviewers tend to make them out to be and really they get killed off quite easily so their not a constant.  Its all about balancing your army and their have been moments where I\'ve been locked in enormous stalemates with other players holding their own.  Like a giant clash of hundreds of units all slowly killing eachother.  At times its brilliantly designed and other times things just don\'t work.  Its a pity steel studios is gone now, as this was their swansong and a nice mix between several of their old titles.  Its really a very simple game with a solid combat system with a few niggling mechanics that just never worked.  Still- it plays very well, the engine is pretty solid, the physics are great, and the whole thing makes you feel like you\'re really in a massive battle at all times.','llamayarmybar','d1c55e83a92200f3d8e1f6d303be284e7d42220c43fc13c7dd02e145992edf03'),(437579,'user',9,'Jun 18, 2006','Superb!

I actually heard about it from my friend, who is kinda fan of Battle Network series and he was excited for this game. But let\'s talk about the game. I heard many complaints that it has pretty hard to learn battle mechanic. Surprisingly, i found it pretty easy, you have to read about 10 minutes of text and you are ready. You must collect cards with different abilities and pick 2/3 during battles, and after using cards you must pick up other cards that\'s given to you by complete random (which is a bit annoying and depends of pure luck). The only hard thing for me was reading storyline, your very first EPIC QUEST was picking up propeller, so Producer will get his flying thing to work in order to gain money. Link, eat your heart out. Basically, all dialogues and story aren\'t really interesting, it kinda feels like some average Bayblade-like anime. But if you\'ll learn how to fight, due to it\'s pick up and play nature and fast-paced combat, game is fun, but it\'s not a safe buy for sure. I cannot recommend this to fans of Mega Man, to fans of mediocre animes, hell, to anybody. It\'s just you either like it or hate. And I\'m the one who enjoyed this game and found pretty fun to play.','JohnLemon','a8f2e6b75efae5a0f8f6c049843b5bbafde1f064aba24f053d79abb02ba300bd'),(437581,'user',10,'Dec 20, 2015','Jogaço, pena não fazerem versões para consoles adoraria ver o jogo rodando no Wii U, em alta definição seria uma maravilha, excelente opção para o Nintendo DS','SSBgames','a8f2e6b75efae5a0f8f6c049843b5bbafde1f064aba24f053d79abb02ba300bd'),(437582,'user',10,'Jun 28, 2020','Жопа патрика выглядит достаточно симметричной относительно лица алексея шевцова, слава коммунизму, Спанч Боб дырявый - это добавляет определенного шарма кат-сценам которые кстати чуть не бомбанули мою пс4 (10/10)','obozrevatelsrak','aee85ddbb1399989efbf40ef784e8fa0ef7637365dbb7aa42f91e57a0b89c73f'),(437583,'user',10,'Jun 28, 2020','ВИВАТ СПАНЧБОБУ!!!

The same complaints put here could be applied to many Pokemon games that existed throughout the years and many of them have and up to Moon received many of them. Many of the reviews claim the graphics are of 4 years ago. Well it was 2006 and a handheld at the end of its life, the GBA SP. So honestly can it.

Since then I\'ve played VII, VIII, XIII, III, and IV. Now before venturing into this game I was well aware that many thought this game only appealed to fans from long ago. In my experience however I\'ve gotten quite addicted to it. I\'m not really sure what it is about this game but other than the art much of this game is far too old. First off, the gameplay is not only extremely simple, but extremely easy. Much of your commands will involve holding down circle until one of your team mates are low on health, which will take a while. There are also quite a lot of random encounters, which really bugged me at first but I got used to them fairly quickly. You should also understand that there is no story in this game, you will relate with none of the characters and most of your quests are about killing someone to save someone or fetching something to do something. Probably my biggest criticism about this game is that is does nothing to help guide you to your objectives. The game\'s simplicity is perfect for playing on a bus or in a line but because of the extremely ambiguous goals, you\'ll often find yourself looking up what to do on a strategy guide. That being said I really do like the retro and simple feel of the game as well as the amazing art but it could have been much more fun with an objective marker.','theshonen8899','a42e1d46f2e9b444ec0e9f3eb60b9e08d384b56ad159e588c0532a5847efc966'),(437995,'user',10,'Jun 21, 2005','Absolutely superb couldn\'t stop playing it.','NathanH.','b7899bff8b5fdbfceea46832fab291c0cdfdfcb367e92bf0aed0f3a5ce0878f5'),(437996,'user',10,'Jan  2, 2007','all cs are good i have all , source , 1.6 , cz ... i play all cuz they are different ... the gameplay is different too ... we can be good in 1.6 and bad in cz thats why the geeks of 1.6 says \"cz is for n00bs\" ... tri it and play for fun','fughellscream','f317c5c486c8f97067931414df4fade261b5947d8fb20d59ec1b4edd0568f568'),(437997,'user',10,'Jan  7, 2008','Well die hard counter strike 1.6 players will be amazed to play this game .

This is the definitive version of the game, with design upgrades that make it quite nice to look at and extra dungeons that give the player something challenging to attempt. The story and gameplay works all the same, with just some basic tweaks  such as set magic usages being replaced by the now commonplace MP system (which is a major improvement) and some names being adjusted due to latter entries in the series creating more popular names (ie: Life is now Phoenix Down, Imps are now Goblins, Ice is now Blizzard, Orbs are now Crystals, etc). This is a must play for any RPG fan and a must own for any Final Fantasy fans. Just be prepared to wander around aimlessly searching for hints as to what you\'re supposed to do next, as you often have to fetch a hidden item from some dungeon or town in order to be able to progress to the next section of the game.

The flexibility of the storyline is improved, and the reasons to fight is clearly stated and expressed. There are even illegal cards to find and the new system known as Noise is introduced. However, the whole thing still remains mostly the same. Except for being able to finalise into Red Joker or Black Ace depending on the titles, the battles, the music and the graphics are of the same quality. Soundtracks turn annoying when you have to visit the same places over and over again. The characters are really giving you a hard time to decide whether to hate or like with the several cutscenes of them coming to you, saying their nonsense, and go. The mini-challenges in the game are still acceptable, but I just couldn\'t take myself to suit with the Meteor Server\'s(Last stage), with that Crimsons flying all over and giving you purposeless random battles without a reward. I was kind of disappointed by this constant unchange, but fairly well improvements were made to creating the storyline.

Lastly, in addition to the new MP system for magic, by adding Dash abilities, quicker leveling and removing some lackluster battle system elements allows this game to play out a lot faster than originally; I think you could probably beat the game in about half the time despite accomplishing just as much.','NojEsco','a42e1d46f2e9b444ec0e9f3eb60b9e08d384b56ad159e588c0532a5847efc966'),(438083,'user',7,'Jul 15, 2009','Always been a big fan of the megaman battle network series so I was a little disappointed when it ended and capcom replaced it with the starforce series which seemed to only simplify the things that made the original series so great. however this third installment I thoroughly enjoyed.

EA could have just stuck to the old formula of The Sims 2 (and would have still sold a lot of copies). But, they took risks with the Sims 3. These risks paid off, BIG TIME! After playing Sims 3 you wonder how we ever managed before? There is now a whole town that you can explore in (which looks incredible btw), all with no loading screens. There is new music, and combined with the look of the game feels like you are playing a game of Desperate Housewives or the Stepford Wives. While this by it self is great there is a lot more. New \"moodlets\" keep the game much more interesting, as do lifetime wishes. I did think that I would miss all of The Sims 2 expansions, but EA have taken the best from each and put them all into The Sims 3. The game continues to impress me everytime I play it, there is so much depth. The only problem I can find is with performance.

People like what they like, and don\'t like what they don\'t. But don\'t try to complain about lack of originality when a game is built solid and you just aren\'t into it. Of all the games in the SW/DW series, Empires is by far the most engaging. Xtreme Legends (especially 5) has more RPG-like elements, however.

Но эту я прошел до конца несмотря на все сложности. В ней все имеет последствия, в ней все продумано. Она дарит уникальный опыт и имеет огромные возможности реиграбельности.

Но один балл все же сниму, за две вещи. Во-первых, система диалогов. Несмотря на огромное количество вариантов ответов, они почти ни на что не влияют. Даже когда отвечаешь абсолютно по разному, диалог линеен. А в ролевых играх диалоги крайне важная вещь. Во-вторых, даже после прохождения непонятно огромное количество вещей. Зачем спасать людей и персонажей? Это очень дорогой процесс, но толку? Ради пары-тройки квестов? Да и те зачастую разочаровывали. Потратил кучу времени на спасение, например, Ласки или других детей. А все квесты появлявшиеся вокруг них были бредовыми. Какие-нибудь пустые, ни к чему не приводящие диалоги, или же хоть и сюжетные, но в целом бесполезные и сразу забывающиеся события.

I really found the story in this game to be one of the big highlights, as there are alot of plot twists, good story advancements, character backstories etc. Though the games story is rather short, you will spend alot of time leveling up, collecting items and weapons, buying new weapons, and also using a cool new system, where when you defeat enemies, you can unlock them to be used as drones, and send them off to each of the 10 zones, leveling them up to collect item and weapons, scout out new info, etc. this is a really great concept and adds some depth to the game. There are lots of characters, all witgh detailed and interesting backstories, and the main villian (and villains) and the way the scenes play out in the game are done extremely well. The music is fantastic in this game as well. its at times exhilirating, at times sad, at times pumping, every track fits the situation accordingly. there are 10 chapters in this game (basically how the levels and story arcs are split up) and on each new story chapter, you travel to another location, and after beating said chapter, you unlock the location to afterwards freely explore and send drones to. the game can be quite difficult, and boss battles can go on for what seems like hours (especially bosses like botos who heal themselves) but the game is very rewarding for your hard work, and leving up unlocks new special techniques your character can use.All together, this game is a great first attempt at making an rpg for megaman (not including the battle network series) great music, graphics, characters, gameplay, and story, makes this a very addicting and exciting rpg, that, while short, i highly reccomend to any and all megaman fans, and even rpg fans in general!','bonnin40','2602936ece200f252fff057451500c723fd01cb819ecc5bf865aafd513bffa42'),(438661,'meta',95,'Not Defined','The videogame equivalent of striking gold...

The series did turn out to continue using \"souls\" and eventually found out how to do it correctly. Battle Network 4 was weak in the story department and although having fun gameplay, the game forces you to grind the story 3 or 4 times in order to 100% the game and that gets tedious after the first play-through. I can see how users would rate this game highly if it was their first exposure to the Battle Network games because the Battle Network games are totally unlike other games and they are incredible amounts of fun.

If yes, then you\'re all good. However, this game is what Clock Tower 3 should have been in the first place. With the A.I programmed to never stop looking for you, a dog companion to assist you and a larger variety of hiding spots Haunting Ground could might as well be called Clock Tower 4. The stalkers are so much more threatening since even after they leave the room you\'re hiding in, they keep on looking for you which raises the fear factor and the music that accompanies them is truly adds to the game. That being said, they can get annoying at times, appearing at times where you\'re doing a puzzle or trying to get from point A to point B. Other mechanics such as panic mode, your dog companion which can go to out-of-reach areas, find items which will assist you, growling when a stalker is near and attack the stalkers when they\'re chasing you. This game has also has very detailed art and the facial expressions of the characters are very vivid (unlike many other games at the time). Even though this game has many ups to it, one thing that can be said is that it has mediocre replay value. There aren\'t that many things for you to do in this game. I guess you could look for rare items. You could also try to get all the endings and beat the game in hard mode but other than that, the replay value is ok. It isn\'t the type of game i\'d take out and play a week after I completed it for the first time. Hard mode is, well, just a harder version of the game with the only difference (other than the difficulty) being the color of the clothes the stalkers wear. You could also try and get the unlockable costumes for both Fiona and Hewie.

The voice overs are amazing done, the visuals are fantastic, and the gameplay is more original than resident evil 4. I just can\'t stand how people don\'t look at this game and realize how wonder it is. They always compare it to Resident Evil 4. Although that is a great game it doesn\'t have much orginality to it. Your in a abandon village getting attacked by monsters to help someone. It has great gameplay but is not as compelling or scary as Haunting Ground.

The \"drawback\" is that there are certain parts of it that are going to feel aged. And you know what? So what? For those of us who grew up playing really well done RPG\'s on the PS1 and PS2, this game will hit you with wave after wave of nostalgia. The combat is strategic enough to keep you thinking and working, but still very fast passed with its RTS design, so those of you who don\'t like slow, grid based combat, have no fear. The story is familiar for most RPG faithful: huge continent at war with everyone fighting each other while political puppeteers make everyone dance in the shadows. Meanwhile a larger threat looms, threatening to destroy everyone indiscriminately. But the story is told so well that the things that happen that aren\'t a surprise to most of us don\'t really matter. You still care about the people and the events despite seeing them a dozen other times in other stories. The story is also harsh and unforgiving, Without spoiling too much, the story kills characters off everywhere. No one seems safe as each hour unfolds. The game is just about perfect in every way (despite looking a bit aged). If you aren\'t interested in a trip down nostalgia lane with a soon to be classic RPG, go back to playing some mindless CoD or Gears of War and leave the rest of us to enjoy a game that embraces good story telling and a game that will sink it\'s claws in you and not let go.','Surbmonster','33430ac62f392be4b7d66972c549076b5afa3ebb9ba71d35555253866e14184b'),(439116,'user',9,'Oct  6, 2009','i agree with James M they prolly played for a good 15 mins before deciding to quit where you should prolly be in the lab for a good half hour before you start playing just like real training. the controls are only difficult because they have to rhythm after playing for like an hour its not very diffficult to hit beats while executing rediculous combos. the only thing i\'m sad about is there could\'ve been more story and i really wanted to use my character on arcade mode.','TurtleB.','11e61185fbbe131f27efd4f7cc808c515624f31f79f38da39487df3eb9af7159'),(439117,'user',10,'Dec 14, 2006','I just want to get this straight. All the reviewers that reviewed this game are obviously people that have no interest in bboying. They don\'t have a passion for it and therefore they can\'t relate to the dancing at all and don\'t understand it at all. Therefore they CANNOT possibly review this game properly based on how accessible it is to them. This game is strictly for the bboys out there and those who have an interest in the hiphop culture. To enjoy and appreciate this game, you sort of have to be a bboy or have knowledge about it and the dance. As a bboy myself i can see that it took a lot of effort to make this game, and i know that it will not dissappoint any of the bboys out there simply because you can relate to it and when you\'re controlling your guy on the screen pulling off moves you can\'t yet do in real life you\'ll be like \"damn i\'m versing physicx...this is so cool\". for anyone not into bboying and not knowing who physicx or any of the other famous bboys are...you will not enjoy the game as much, as shown by the reviews. seeing famous bboys pullin off their signature moves and watching their actual motion captured dancing will definitely appeal to those who know them. if u loved ballet and there was a ballet game which i found absolutely boring, does that make it a crap game? no, because i dont do ballet, but to those who do, it might be a great game. get the point peoples?','Hong10','11e61185fbbe131f27efd4f7cc808c515624f31f79f38da39487df3eb9af7159'),(439118,'user',8,'Jan  4, 2020','This game should really be more well-known in survival horror circles.

Story wise, it\'s straight to the point, where Gladio separates from his crew to seek power in a secret dungeon of the world of XV. This will be content added to the main story of the game but from Gladio\'s and Cor\'s perspective. Last but not least, the music is great, it totally fits Gladio\'s personality and the dark dungeon setting, and the final boss theme is a masterpiece. On my first playthrough, it took me 2-hours to beat the first trial on Normal Mode. The length of the dungeon is perfect. After you complete the first trial, you unlock extras that will add 2 to 4-hours of extra gameplay (depending on your level of skill and chosen difficulty level), making a total of 4 to 6-hours of gameplay for Gladio\'s $5 DLC. If you do well, you will win prizes that will pass over to the main game. Beware, the optional super boss is very hard to defeat (which is a great thing), I suggest replaying Score Mode until you have mastered Gladio first. I hope Square Enix continues to add more DLC and updates to FFXV, it\'s a really good game.','Ffan','e0af270b3b21daf194638e0c6b826dfa8c1a1d31b8a56b7a84aea98ec3926328'),(439418,'user',10,'Aug  8, 2011','Pure awesome-ness in game form.

The music is perfectly suited to Gladio\'s character and the combat - heavy-hitting and thrilling. Story-wise, the DLC delves into Cor\'s past, while providing slightly more depth to Gladio. You get a stronger feel for the character because of the DLC. My one real criticism is that they could\'ve delved into Gladio\'s motivations and character a bit more, because there is a lot of room for him to grow, though what they\'ve done is fine. The combat is where this DLC really shines. The developers moved away from Noctis\' combat style, but kept it fast-paced and fun even without the use of warp. The DLC has some replay-ability, though not too much. After beating the Episode on normal mode, you unlock a \'Score Attack\' mode which offers new achievements and in-game outfits. Episode Gladio is fun and worth the very low entry fee. It provides a fun combat system, interesting lore, great music and the development of Gladio\'s character.

Im a megaman fan since a remember.....the first \"mega\" game I played was X1....and i loved it. with the first 2D (i mean ALL 2D) megaman game on the ps2....capcom has finally decided that is time to put more things on this legendary saga.... to make it shortly this are the things that makes MegamanX8 a Greatest HIts (I hope!!): -very detailed graphics, make the attacks much more interestings -the 3 navigators, the 2 armors and a lot of upgrades put more freedom to the game -the new and cool Double Attack -A LOT of hidden items and weapons (which make the game more depth...because you can end the story but not have all....gotcha;) -the Metals (money)....finally we have a reason to repeat levels!!! -the first game in the world with ALL 2d gameplay but very strong 3d graphics and movie pics But of course not all the games are X-Cellent.....the bad thing are like the difficulty levels.....on easy mode you can easly on 3 or even 2 days complete the game. also the game is (again) short for a ps2 game.....one first level....8 bosses level....2 other level and the final......ONLY 12....the number may be kind of big.....but the large in each level is not that long. CAPCOM SHOULD NOT PUT DIFUCULTY LEVEL (or maybe just Normal and Hard) SO THE DIFFICULTY WILL HELP THE SHORT GAME. MegamanX8 is a great game.....incredible detailed graphics....depth story.....more weapons and upgrades that the saga has ever had....lot of HIDDEN items ( i write it like that because if you are playing without any cheat or hint it will be very difficult to complete the game in 100%........well in easy mode....much of the items are already in the R&D lab).... MY OPINION: max 10 GRAPHICS: 9 SOUND EFFECTS AND MUSIC: 7.5 STORY (well...this is only for fans): 7 FUN FACTOR: 8 GAMEPLAY: 7.5 DEPTH AND VARIETY: 8.5 im sure Caocom has no excuses for not make an incredible MegamanX9 for the ps3 (i said becuase the next year the ps3 is gonna come out and Capcom surely want to make Megaman great again) unfortunetly Capcom made a HUGE error with MegamanX7.....that was just a failure.....and has lost some fans. I dont know what happened, Capcom make the megaman series evolved very good....from NES to SNES with MegamanX.....form the SNES to the Playstation with MegamanX4....and also x5 and X6 were great....unfortunetly they were almost the same..........but with X8.....MEGAMAN HAS COME BACK BAY!!....YEAH!! who could think...that Im Colombian?','JoseS.','bc80bcf0be960ae9ae989ec5afedbe8bb750b3d250cc1311fd1a39a3c91b145b'),(439705,'meta',60,'Not Defined','This game may be relatively simply, but it sure is varied...

The graphics in this game, and the new character designs actually look great. The gameplay is amazing and the controls are amazing, it\'s fast-paced like the original ones. The stages are awesome even if a little short, but still really good, especially towards the end. X8 is filled with content compared to previous titles, which makes it actually worth putting some hours into. The story is a bit over the top, but at least it has a story and it is overall solid. It also has proper cutscenes, which is a first since X4 and very welcome. On the other hand, the boss battles are a little too easy. Some rare metals are impossible to find without a guide. The mini boss at Gravity Antonion\'s stage is really annoying. The soundtrack is overall poor, even if it has some of the best songs in the series like the Title screen, Jakob Elevator, Intermission Theme etc. The two fully 3D stages are also awful. However, at the end of day Mega Man X8 is a fantastic game that was a big step in the right direction, and it shows they were ready to put some effort into the series again.

The general thrust of the reviews is that this is a good  Metroidvania, but that it fails to bring \'anything new\' to the genre - and as such does not arrant a very high review score. This is not correct, and in my opinion, there is something new and fresh feeling in this excellent game. of course, as a Metroidvania, there is something formulaic - but the presentation and delivery of this title does not feel imitative or repetitive. For an indie title with a very small team, this game (the map) is also pretty massive, and it takes way longer to clear than the typical indy Metroidvania does (length wise, it took me a bit longer to complete this than it took to complete Ritual of the Night (35 hours approx), and i have complete Momodora: RutM (a great game) 4 times on all settings and that has clocked less time than 1 Cathedral playthrough). Reading some professional reviews, you can tell they did not actually play through the whole game because some give a completion time of 15-20 hours. I suppose they just extrapolated from the typical lengthier Metroidvania, but there is no way someone is doing a 15-20 hour clear on first playthrough unless they are sitting with a playthrough and boss guide, and racing through the game like that. Average competent gamer is looking at a 32-38 completion time. There are good 100% challenges there for those who like 100%ing a game - which, without a guide, i can see taking 40-45 hours.','DecoyDoctorpus','9747bde33e6e28adaddd8023e826e78ff3e20c386cd9aafe486d642baa74d391'),(439720,'user',8,'Dec 10, 2020','Bom é um jogo Muito bom ele volta ao legal de MegaMen X muito bom','Louquinho286','bc80bcf0be960ae9ae989ec5afedbe8bb750b3d250cc1311fd1a39a3c91b145b'),(439721,'user',8,'Feb 21, 2021','The game is a solid return to the base of the series after the x7 fiasco.

It\'s also probably the most twisted game in existence - I say this primarily because it involves little girls being sadistic and cruel to each other, it\'s a world where there isn\'t just blood and violence, but there\'s humiliation for almost no apparent reason other than that the person being humiliated is lower on a list (the kind of list that young girls often make to rank the people around them). Such humiliation - as seen early on - involves rats on the end of a stick being shoved in someone\'s face, and at one point the rat is dead and rotting, covered in maggots. The psychology of this game really gets to you, and it\'s very surreal, and can easily be compared to Silent Hill (of course its not as great as Silent Hill, nor as psychologically frightening, but it is, in many ways, similar). I would say this is more unsettling than horrifying, but sometimes that\'s all a game with this kind of slow, yet brilliant pacing needs. However, the one single thing that stops this great game from being even greater is the freaking battle controls. Everything in the game is perfectly manageable all until you get to an actual fight. The girl you play as, Jennifer, is so very afraid of everything around her, which I love as a concept, but the fact that she\'s afraid to even defend herself and fights with little feeble attempts is extremely aggravating. At first I thought it was because I was using short range weapons like knives and her fists, but then I discovered the steel pipe. I was so excited when I found this weapon because I thought this meant that she would swing it around more widely, but instead she still does those simply wimpy jabs whilst covering her eyes in fear. This is the most challenging part, because even if you are the most skilled hardcore gamer you will have difficulty. Also she gets knocked down really easily, and though the labrador, Brown, that aides you along the way is great help in fights, it is only so much help as even though it looks like you\'re hitting an enemy, and you see your steel pipe or knife going through the enemy, it will act as though you missed it. I give this a 9/10 because it is a brilliant and outstanding example of style and story, plus it has the greatest \"GAME OVER\" screen in existence, as it acts as the end of a story, in a most twisted and devious way - \"...And they all lived happily ever after.\"','doodlerman','f12afc4a94f5a6ba15703295a5f388e6723a713c2677fac1688a407bf64e76ea'),(439733,'meta',80,'Mar 10, 2021','There may be little original content in this adventure, but Cathedral collates a lot of classic gaming principles to wrap them up successfully in a retro-inspired Metroidvania tale.

Many monsters can take a character down with just a few hits. My only two main gripes were that, yes, the story was a bit cliche once you figured out what was going on.

It\'s very hard or impossible at times to defeat so many enemies. Backtracking is a routine, and 5 seconds worth of loading time separating you from the room next door also sum up to the frustration, thanks to having to use the dog to find every damn item. Aware of the poor combat mechanics in advance I went for the Rusty Sword to make my experience a bit less frustrating and I recommend anyone reading this to do so. From my understanding, the story is quite simple but how it is told is so convoluted and bizarre. One of the adults in the game is depicted as a pedophile, though it is not true... They did it so people would pay more attention to the game? No wonder it was banned everywhere. It\'s worth playing at least once, if you can overlook the broken combat and item search systems, but I didn\'t and still wouldn\'t pay what people are asking for an original copy nowadays. If you love Rule of Rose and want to show appreciation for their work, the only logic method to support the long gone Punchline in the current time is to buy their only other game, Chulip, digitally available as a PS2 Classic for the PS3. Supporting the studio founded by the director of RoR, Onion Games, is an option too. Buying an overpriced DVD that will inevitably rot away won\'t be of any help to them. Spend wisely. Taking everything good about RoR into account, I\'m giving it a score of 7 because I refuse to believe that budget was a problem for the developers, since it was commissioned and published by Sony as an exclusive for their console. It deserved more love, and I honestly want to know what went wrong along the way for the game to be launched in such a unplayable state.','Razzee','f12afc4a94f5a6ba15703295a5f388e6723a713c2677fac1688a407bf64e76ea'),(439856,'user',10,'Dec 21, 2019','Best psychological story with Silent hill of era survival horror ever made.

It\'s satisfying to coax an enemy state\'s major officers into joining your side, taking their armies with them, then attacking their former state and maybe using the policy \"Capture\" to snap up any officers that were not willing to be bribed earlier.

It\'s decent enough and while i found it fun, the gameplay not being anything deep might not be everyone\'s cup of tea. It can also get sort of repetitive but for story reasons. Now the story, wow this story is such a rich and well written story. The story is very original, it\'s not generic or anything. Just when you think you\'ve figured out the story it just pulls you back in and sends you off into another direction. It\'s one of my favorite videogame stories I\'ve ever had the privilege to play through. This is why I give this game a 10. Gameplay might not be anything special but the story is fantastic that it makes up for its few flaws. I highly recommend this wonderful game! Plus there\'s a dog in the game you can pet, easily a 10/10.','Starzen517','687157376eb541f057341122b148d4f911d740286a01ceb2f6e598de534c8414'),(439979,'user',10,'Feb  5, 2020','A masterpiece in every sense of the word, beautiful graphics, a delightful piano soundtrack, and brilliant writing.','tesadesrvdbetta','687157376eb541f057341122b148d4f911d740286a01ceb2f6e598de534c8414'),(439980,'user',9,'Feb 19, 2020','Достоинства','motymurm','687157376eb541f057341122b148d4f911d740286a01ceb2f6e598de534c8414'),(439981,'meta',49,'Not Defined','It feels like the only reason this game has a third version (or a second version for that matter), is because Nintendo knows kids expect it, and will snatch it up.

LEGO Battles is at once a simple and fun game, and a terribly dull one with too many rules to learn for too little payoff later in the game. I fear this is a project not of love for the incredible gaming company that has produced LEGO Star Wars et al, but just a finished project -- one they may have enjoyed building at the start but were clearly unable to turn into something truly enjoyable for any particular audience. My son suffered as much of the tutorial level as possible but even so was not impressed with the graphics or the gaming style. The LEGO brand does not save this game from being just another RTS. What this has done is awoken certain nostalgic feelings for Blizzard games like Starcraft, which I would much rather be playing.

The first thing worth noting is that this game is nothing like the Lego games that have come out earlier (Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana Jones, etc.).  Where those games were more on arcade style action, this one is real time strategy, a game genre that is usually only available on computers.  This, however, came out on the Nintendo DS.  Surprisingly, for a genre that\'s more popular on computers, they actually did a pretty decent job.  Of course, this game would be so much better on a Windows, but this strategy game is still pretty good on the DS.  This game may be different then Warcraft, but it still has a few tricks up its sleeve.  It has a lot of funny cutscenes, great gameplay moments, and fun campaigns.  However, the gameplay, while it\'s fun, does have its faults.  As I said earlier, the campaigns are enjoyable, but the instant action battles leave a lot to be desired.  They can be very short, and often times boring.  The campaigns more then make up for this however.  The graphics could be better, but I still like them anyway.  The pixelized graphics are alright, but they do lack detail.

The story is filled with random characters who all have little motivation to do what they are doing. It\'s as if the developers made some story, then actually played a mission... Then they tried to continue their story without reviewing what they wrote before the mission. There\'s a whole disjointed feel to it all. It\'s as if the story and characters are all trying to go somewhere but don\'t go anywhere at all. Yes, it\'s a beginner\'s RTS game, but it\'s not very user friendly. I think it would have been great on the PC. It sort of reminds of StarCraft Brood War in a sense that there are no rally points and you can only select a small amount of units. So the game is you constantly selecting units and then constantly scrolling back to your base (since there are no hotkeys) to make units. I will say that the art is awesome.','AceOfCakez','a1dded3ebe032fdf8085ffa4020c155b15e28e238e2e9039904f90c191375454'),(440273,'user',8,'Mar 30, 2018','Pretty interesting and awesome strategy game.

The story is a high point, and while there is some confusing things due to the time travel mechanics, it doesn’t take away the from it at all. This game will make you FEEL and is without a doubt the best story in a Pokemon game. The gameplay is very intense as well. You still get your classic 4 moves and multiple Pokémon to use, but you are limit to parties of four. Most of the time the game will require you to play as just you and your partner, but this opens up in the post game. The only disappointing thing to me was the fact that you couldn’t evolve your character until the end. Otherwise this is a fantastic and enjoyable experience and highly recommended.

This game looks beautiful, the character design and background design in the cutscenes is gorgeous, the music is good and the game play at least for a noob like me is good, but, my biggest issue is the variety of stages, every battle feels almost identical and kinda repetitive because the stages look almost similar, I mean there are important differences on their structure but nothing too dramatic to fool your mind, imagine that you play a fighting game and you only play in the same stage with the same background, sure every fight will be different but then again it feels tired, that aside what keeps me going was the story, it has a very interesting twist and is almost like a character study.

This game is a GEM!! Easily in the top 5 best Nintendo DS games of all time. Explorers of Sky takes everything that was great about the previous Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games and makes them even better. Having played Explorers of Time back in the day (which this game is basically an expansion of), I mostly forgot the details of the story so playing this game again was a nearly fresh experience. After the introduction, the story never got dull and was full of twists & surprises and always kept me wanting to know what happens next. Characters are lovable and have unique and memorable personalities with plenty of mystery surrounding others. Over the course of the game, you develop a bond with your partner that’s even stronger than the one in Blue/Red Rescue. I\'m not gonna lie, I almost cried a little at the end of the main story. Pokemon games are known for having great soundtracks and the music here doesn\'t disappoint, infact its got some of the best tracks from the whole Pokemon series. It does a perfect job at setting the appropriate tone consistently throughout the game and I\'ve spent hours looking up covers to some of my favorite tracks on Youtube. After finishing Explorers of Sky I\'m craving more Mystery Dungeon. If you’re someone looking to play a good Nintendo DS classic then look no further.. and if you’re a Pokemon fan and you still haven’t played this game yet what are you waiting for??

The story follows the adventure of your character, who is a Pokémon based off of your personality ( Which is a very good system, I hope it is used more in other games) , and your partner.  You begin to love every character to the point where losing them is the worst possible nightmare scenario. As the story progresses you learn more about yourself, like the fact that your a time paradox, or that you were once a human, and so many more surprises. The ending is what makes most cry, even the most hardened. You have to bear watching your very slow disappearing from reality itself as your partner crys.

As a player, it didn\'t just become a game to me anymore, but it lets the player connect emotionally with the characters and makes them bond with their partner unlike some other games where they don\'t really have full emotional connections with you. You are the main character and you are born to save the world from stopping the paralysis of time. You and your partner. You connect with all the folks in your guild, you get plot twists, the characters such as Dusknoir and Grovyle are one of the most shocking truths of the game since you would\'ve never known that you were  actually one of his partners. But you forgot about him.. It gives you such sorrowful moments that even though you know Grovyle who was your former partner knew you forgot him he sacrificed himself anyway. This game makes you ride an emotional journey through the feel trains and even after all the moments with your partner even they leave you on the end.

For me personally the gameplay gets very bland and repetitive. It\'s pretty much the same thing throughout the whole game with nothing interesting. Item management can get annoying like how your inventory is always full and is just a mess. The menus too are pretty bad, I have to access the menu everytime i want to use an attack where you can only set one of them to a quick key. I hated exploring very bland randomly generated dungeons. The only thing that kept me going was the storyline. I always wanted to see more of it, it was surprisingly good and got pretty deep too for a Pokémon game. Music too is top notch here.

Do you build your team mates with strong melee attacks for bosses and if they get separated from you (admittedly too often due to the AI sometimes it wants to do its own thing and make you watch \"Terry the Tangela\'s misadventures\" tm) or have ranged attacks they can use to support in most encounters from behind you or to the side of your group because FRIENDLY FIRE IS A THING IN A POKEMON GAME (although the ai will never attack you unless it has the confused status, it will just limit range compared to other attacks that have a more limited range overall but can bypass allies)','Nohri','4dba3d07f4a002bc1c071df3bf51b1302d46798077809729af5c8e6cffb26850'),(440588,'user',7,'Feb 21, 2021','I\'ve got to be honest, I love no, ADORE Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. The game is filled with interesting and compelling characters, with a surprisingly deep and open-ended story. While the story itself has a definitive ending, there are so many elements of the story that are still shrouded in mystery and hasn\'t been fully explored, this doesn\'t make the story bad but instead it leaves room for interpretations and theories to explain several plot holes or even explain parts of the story that were already explained thoroughly but can be connected with other parts of the story, making things so much more interesting. But the deep lore isn\'t the only reason the story is great, the story itself is just so well-written and so wonderful and really sad at certain points. However, this being a Pokemon game hurts more than it helps, as people are less likely to appreciate the story of a Pokemon game as unprofessional critics or people with a prejudice against Pokemon will simply dismiss the story as a basic story for kids. Of course, there are people who aren\'t so quick to judge, but they will most likely be turned off by the repetitive gameplay. Speaking of which, the gameplay can feel super repetitive and the dungeons being randomly generated can lead to ridiculous and irritating scenarios, dungeon floors can be insanely fast to go through or could take a millennia to traverse; not to mention, some enemies will randomly ambush you, while I\'m fine with this, if one of your teammates get ambushed by an enemy, it\'s really annoying as every turn you move, the camera moves over to your teammate; but the game does require strategy and needs you to preserve max elixirs and restorative items and when to use items that can help you in boss battles, which is nice; oh, and one more thing, the A.I. of your teammates can be stupid at times which will could cost you a reviver seed and that\'s never fun. So, in conclusion, this game has a wonderful story with rich characters and deep lore, but is held back by it\'s repetitive gameplay and annoying quirks. If you are considering to play this game and you\'re a Pokemon fan, then you\'ll most likely like this game, it borrows a few features from the mainline series so it should feel a little familiar. If you\'re not a Pokemon fan, then this game might not be for you, however if you are interested then please don\'t dismiss this game right away, you might end up enjoying this game.','JetThePokeGuy','4dba3d07f4a002bc1c071df3bf51b1302d46798077809729af5c8e6cffb26850'),(440589,'user',10,'Apr 25, 2020','Well, I will say the rating on this game is the only reason I made an account.

Actually I lie; I felt that when I played Wolfenstein 3D first. Here was a game that truly started the 3D revolution - it proved that an immersive, first-person experience was possible on the computer and in my eyes at the time, I saw a future of photorealistic environments obeying the laws of physics where a story set in any world imaginable centred around you. As far as I was and are now, concerned this is where computer games will end up; the place where ordinary people can live extraordinary lives. Wolfy3D showed that the photorealism in computer games was going to be achievable, all it needed was a bit more beef under the hood of your PC. And so with relish (and not a little imagination) I ate up Wolfy. Then Doom. The sheer pleasure of exploring a basic, yet fundamentally believable environments - with guns - was every bit the revolution it deserved to be. Then came Doom 2, and I the magic was beginning to fade - I couldn\'t quite put my finger on it... the graphics were better, there were more demons... but I was enjoying it less... and not for the first time, I was reintroduced to the axiom; gameplay is king. Then came Quake, Quake 2 (fully 3D characters) and a multitude of followers. Every one improving on the previous one\'s graphics, making the world seem more real, but all forgetting the impetus that led them there. The search for the realistic world in your PC was continuing apace visually, but was neglecting the most importanct aspect; interactivity. Since then, the gaming community has periodically roused from it\'s creative slumber to give us the likes of Half-Life, Deus-Ex, Morrowind etc. Always we were waiting for what ID did next to point the industry back towards where it will eventually end up. And so we come to Doom 3. What are ID telling us now? Well for one thing, they are telling us that bump and specular mapping with polygon-heavy environs, dynamic lighting, physics, 5.1 sound, 2x antialiasing can run very fast on a moderate system (2.8G, 1G RAM, 9800PRO). To have created such a rich environment and have it run so well is truly impressive. And what they say about game \'polish\' should be a lesson to all. Computer panel access, cut-scene integration, PDA, the use of positional sound and lighting - the whole game reeks of the time they took to make sure every last little experience is a cut above what has gone before - although I might have a small gripe about the quality of some bump and spec. maps (even on extreme) which are not always as detailed as some in Far Cry, or the heat effects which again are not always quite as realistic. But these are mere triffles when such a convincing world has been created as in Doom 3. But that is where the good ends. The only other thing to commend ID on is the name; this truly is the third Doom game. You walk into a room, you get attacked. Your press a button, you get attacked. You pick up armour; attacked. Don\'t look behind you? Attacked. New weapon lying on the ground? Attacked. Not been attacked for a while? Wall opens and you probably get the idea... Worse still, these aren\'t monsters that are waiting in corridors or ducts that you flush out or hear having an argument - you can\'t surprise these demons - they appear when you pass the pre-programmed point and not a moment before. Pass the point and you will no doubt hear the noise of a demon being conjured from an electric disturbance nearby (reminiscent of anything?) but even that is not needed. I once walked through a door backwards and saw two spiders literally appear out of nowhere. Okay you may say I am being picky, but that the designers could not have though of a better way to infest a world with shootables is very disappointing. You start to get the impression that ID spend the ENTIRE FIVE YEARS on the engine for this game but a week on the gameplay. Or maybe no time at all? All this really is is Doom 2004. If they took the time to copy the story of Half-Life (science installation goes wrong, opens portal from another dimension which infests installation with beasts), the beginning (walking round installation before disaster) and the method of beast appearance (ball of electricity) - you might as well just swap the word \"Xen\" with \"Hell\" - why did they leave out the friendly interaction and AI? Yes, there is NO AI in Doom 3 - demons see you as soon as they appear (i.e. you are close enough - even if hidden) and then go straight for you. The more I play thins game, the more it amazes me that they though so little about the games that have come before it (except Half-Life of course). There is no stealth, no headshots, no need for ammo conservation, no using friendlies, no branching routes, no branching story (you might think there is but there isn\'t), no respite from attack. No subtlety. Graphically, this game delivers as advertised; it is the benchmark. Concerning gameplay, it competes with the likes of Doom 1 and 2, Quake, Serious Sam etc. Quite how so many reviewers have ignored this is really quite amazing.

The localization / synchronization was amazing. It improved the atmosphere and was nearly universally praised. I only found out about it after research because I couldn\'t believe the low ratings this game got in other countries (10-20 percent lower). Back to the game: You play as Samuel Gordon who returns home after his grandfather took his own life. He didn\'t believe that his grandfather would commit suicide and wants to know the truth. He got no real help from his relatives and is on his own. The story is really good. There are a lot of family secrets and plot twist. The story is always engaging and I enjoyed the new revelations and puzzles. The final reveal will shock you but is fitting and well explained. It makes sense in hindsight like all good mysteries. You get what you can expect from a point and click adventure. You must solve puzzles and combine items. All riddles / puzzles are fair and solvable. I must admit that I looked up thinks in a walktrough but never said that it was illogical or unsolvable. It was more I got thinking in the wrong direction. Overall this was my first point and click adventure that got hooked me up.

These remarkable editors, such as a dungeon editor, a map editor, and a building editor, rate this game a 10. However, as the player engages further into the programming, he or she will find him or herself travelling in a loop because of the heart of the game: The scripting editor. If the player does not manage to persevere this perplexion, he/she will find great disinterest in the program and rate in something low, such as a 3/10. Nevertheless, if the player does manage to articulate the great information within the program, they will be overjoyed and thus give it a 10/10. The method I would suggest to aclimate to the script and event functions is Trial and Error. The joy of the program is not the freedoms or great editors, it is the fact that you can literaly create a virtual universe where you are God! Then you can make another individual play your game and challenge them to defeat your immagination, which you inputed into the game.

The gameplay is simple yet challenging enough, rewarding skill with extra points, which can be used to buy Vanessa new clothes... sorry, suits, each with its own characteristics and special moves. The graphics are very good - everything is clear despite the continuous blasting. The only gripe I have is the 30fps screen refresh - it would have been great to have the game run at 60fps, but alas! BTW the PAL version should only be played on the 60Hz setting, since on 50Hz things are a lot jerkier. The sound effects are mediocre but the music is great, if a bit repetitive.

I had no experience with game editing before playing it, and you can probably imagined that I was confused as all get-out at first. Well, me and my friend were both in the same boat on this one, but every weekend we would go to each other\'s houses and work on our games, imparting what little knowledge we had learned over the week to each other. After about a year or so, we decided we were pro. If it was CAPABLE of being done on RPG Maker, there was no doubt in our minds we could do it easily. Most people can\'t even concieve the idea of making a boat that you actually get in, and ride around, or making a general lead an army forward (all of them moving at once), then turning around to talk to his troops, then all of them moving forward at once again. Or a base designing sytem which allows you to have place to store, and manually choose your characters while upgrading the base and selection of items its stores have to offer. Oftentimes, even the most pro RPG Maker players are perplexed by how to script such things, and if you know how you are pro too. I am self learned from the days I couldn\'t figure out even how to make the inside of a house, so please do not think I am giving this game a bad review because it is confusing. I eagerly awaited this game for so long, and months ahead of time, I knew it would have bad graphics. So did the first one. The fact of the matter is you simply can\'t have that much customization, and have good graphics to boot. This was no big deal to me. When I put this game in, I had no idea the horror that awaited me. My first problem was the controls. There are so many places in the game that lack menus in favor of \"To do this function rotate this analog stick this way, and then this way!\" which is ridiculous. I\'m trying to design a game, not play one. There should be no challenge to getting the game made if you know what to do. That being said, the method of gameplay for if you don\'t know what to do is awful as well. Begginer and Moderate difficulites set you up with so much pre-made data you\'re not making your own game anymore, but if you delete it, you are on advanced mode, in which hitting people doesn\'t even do damage unless you script it to do so. It\'s bad all right. Then comes the most awful thing of all. Almost all scenario scripting doesn\'t work correctly. Set a teleporting event using the X,Y,Z coordinates precisely, then test it, and watch as the game manages to screw a simple command like that up, making you teleport at all kinds of crazy and random places! I\'m suprised Agetec was able to make the half-decent test game at all seeing as how almost 5% of stuff you script bugs out if you\'re in Advanced difficulty. Just plain wrong. I honestly would have settled for the old RPG Maker with a variable option, better control of duplicate events, and the freedom of the room of a PS2 memory card. Battle scripting would also have been nice. If they would have been smart and just added those, you\'d have the tool you need make anything happen. Overall, RPG Maker 2 just isn\'t user friendly be you noob or pro. Bad controls, bad scripting, bad starting data. At least the map editor was pretty cool.','AlexC.','f1bef1fc072136b6d710d150b48e7425f38bb2d635aa98ab8c616c1ac13849ac'),(440788,'meta',70,'Jun 16, 2020','Summer in Mara is a whimsical adventure that doesn’t require the player to micromanage their days.

I think the controls are very good (better when played from the bumper cam mode as opposed to the outside cameras) and the excitement you feel at times when buildings are collapsing around you, and jumbo jets are crashing towards you.  It really is brilliant.  Plenty of variety in the tracks, lots of unlockables and loads of play time make this one of the best racers on the handheld.

It was the most fun I have had with a dynasty warriors game since DW3. In this entry they got rid of the enemies coming through gates that you can close and added a weapon switching system. I kinda miss being able to shut off the enemies in some levels but it did seem to make it a bit more realistic. The weapon switching was a bit challenging to learn at first but once I got the hang of it, it made the game that much better. It allowed me to use other general\'s weapons that I might have already leveled up with my weaker characters which made getting them stronger a bit more interesting. I also liked how the story system changed in that you start at the beginning of each respective faction and go through a timeline using many different characters. It was a bit different than just choosing one guy and going through the same 6-7 levels over and over again. They still retain the free mode where you can play all the levels you\'ve unlocked and added in a dynasty mode where you can choose one character and build up a city with defeated generals joining your cause. The game looked great in handheld mode, as I saw very little difference between playing on a tv. I really have no complaints about this game. It was really the perfect Dynasty Warriors game.','Corificness','95029d4f912d2c0c7699e6b0a9b739ba3f377111a0551ee48f20a26435b288ba'),(441002,'user',9,'Mar 10, 2003','This game is great, but when you unlock everything the only way to entertain yourself is to play against friends.

I love the third installement and was disappointed that the fourth version did not include more violent looking creatures. After I starting playing Bloody Roar 4 all my other games have been gathering dust. The game is just so much more fun than Soul Calibur and VF4. A Bloody Roar expert like myself was astounded by the additional strategy needed to beat my friends. The darker look is really cool. I never liked the music of the series much (BR4 included) so I always play with it down. The sound effects are to die for. The official game critics who review the franchise are definitely novices to say that no strategy is involved. There is no better way to beat a friend on a big screen TV with sound effects maxed out. I hope the series does well and that they bring back the fox, the gorilla and big mama boar for a final installment. XBOX can keep the elephant. Bloody Roar 4 is a must buy for any fighting game fan. The only other downside to BR4 is that there are many more ferocious animals that could have been added to the franchise (5 feline-like characters is overkill and a crow/spurious/little dog won\'t be giving anybody nightmares).','RagaLover','c36b39cf3b487562cd78c17052319173e8142f8226185783158b4966767f2476'),(441108,'meta',80,'Jan  7, 2019','While it might seem odd for Omega Force to opt to port the five-year-old Dynasty Warriors 8 over the more recent Dynasty Warriors 9, it’s by and far the right decision for Nintendo Switch owners.

Of all the VR games I have played so far, and I have played quite a few, I would definitely have to put this one in my top five.  I have always been fascinated by prehistoric creatures, mainly dinosaurs.  Not only did this game show me detailed models of prehistoric marine life but I was even able to get right up in their faces.  One thing I did not realize about ancient creatures, they have tons of teeth!  This game is by no means Call of Duty or Battlefield and I wouldn\'t even try to compare it to a game like that.  If you are looking for a mind numbing game full of gratuitous violence, this is not that game.  Instead this game is immersive, educational, thought provoking, ground breaking and an absolutely breath taking experience.  It transports you into a world full of prehistoric creature, many of whom want to eat you.  You zip around in your underwater pod checking out all kinds of prehistoric marine life.  If you don\'t care too much about the educational side then you will still have fun playing the game and if you do want to learn a thing or two then there is a really cool database that will tel you all kinds of information about the animals you have studied.  From a learning stand point I think this game is awesome.  I so wish I had something like this when I was a kid.  All I had were stupid math games that wouldn\'t let me progress until I solved a math problem.  This is so much more fun and I know that kids will love learning about prehistoric animals with this game.  There are only two things I could complain about with the game.  One is that you can\'t to above water.  As I stated before I am fascinated with all kinds of prehistoric life.  So I would love to see some future content where you could go above water and check out the land animals.  Second, I soooooo wish there was more content to this game.  I don\'t want to stop playing this game.  I wish there were more things for me to do in it.  But alas, I must wait until the developers release more content.  I know it is coming but I just can\'t wait.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone.  If you can manage to get a VR headset, whether it is an oculus dk2 or a cv1 or a vive, you absolutely HAVE to check this game out.  If you want to get an idea of the game then just check it out on YouTube.  There are several people with gameplay videos uploaded, me included.  They will give you a small idea of what the game is like but honestly videos can never prepare you for what virtual reality is really like.  You just have to experience it for yourself.  Seriously though, get a headset and make sure this game is one of the first you try.  I guarantee you won\'t be disappointed.  I tried this game on an oculus rift DK2.  10 out of 10.  One of my favorite VR games thus far!','DrPancakeFace','29243ba463bc7df691674b036324248d0848f855c78e1b877b626afb204556fe'),(441325,'user',10,'Oct 24, 2003','Great game!!','NevskyK.','8e0ab7af6807a18711d0d98624613fce271d444efd16c0aae3d4fc705bb46041'),(441326,'user',8,'Sep 16, 2003','Simple, nice game, some problems yeah, but still enjoyable enough to play.','[Anonymous]','8e0ab7af6807a18711d0d98624613fce271d444efd16c0aae3d4fc705bb46041'),(441327,'user',10,'Apr 28, 2020','Good old game, kinda nostalgic.

I\'ve never owned Sonic Riders, but I do have Sonic Riers Zero Gravity, and got it as a gift, and my brother and I enjoyed the heck out of it. In fact, I remember fondly one day, my parents and sister (for some reason) went to New York, and me, my brother and my other sister were left home alone with the Playstation and guess what we played? We had a little petend tournaament with that game, and we loved it to death. Picking it up again was as frsh as it was years ago,and just might be one of the few enjoyable 3D Sonic game on the PS2. The story of the game, I could never rap my head around. It revolves around these metorites that fell to the earth, and soon after, robots from a company called Metotech go on a rampage. Tails finds one of these metorites and plans to investigate it at megelo station. The robots attack him, along with Sonic and Kuckles which eventually lead Sonic falling 300 stories down, but by using the power of the metorite the Tails handed to him, he was able to float. Then some sort of tie-in with the babylon rouges, ancient babyloneans, its all very confusing. Maybe its because I never played the first game, but I could never rap my head around it. Its a dissapointment to see that not a lot was put into the campaign mode. Each level you go through, they come up with some fancy goal in disguise as\"just come in fist place\". Its not too bad, but there just feels like theres not a lot to do. The campaign is short and sweet, and after I complete the first campaign, I unlock the Babylonean story, where you get to play as the baylon rouges...and amy for some reason. Theres a track in the baylon story that wasnt in the hero story the contains the true ending to the game. The game is short. but it delivers. There are 8 areas in the game, 2 tracks in each area. Each of them are different, and have their own set of short cuts for different types of gear to go through. Each gear has a certain ability on it that you can either equip with rings during a race or youll have it from the get-go. Some gears can fly, some bash through objects, others fly, and some grind. Those are the three ways of a short cut in the game by regular means. You can use the gravity dive to stick to walls, or go on other platforms while doing a trick. The ways you can get to the finish line is quite exlirating and fun. During a race you collect rings  that can upgrade your gear during a race. Everything from Speed up, ring sheild, get through certain short cuts, increase GP guage, and Its amazing how many gear you can get in the game. You have no idea how long it took me to get all of the gear in the game. During the race, there is a GP guage at the bottom left the limits how much you can use the gravity powers which come in handy if even your short cuts arent getting you anywhere in a race. You can use the gravity dive and gravity burst. The gravity dive allows you to make tight turns, or stick to some short cut walls. Doing so will give a slight boost of speed. Nothing to special, but a nice touch. The gravity burst allows you to go at maximum speed and the ability to fly in the air to crash into objects to get a HUGE burst of speed! It\'s quite exhilerating, and using it will decide wheather you loose or win a race. Now beware, the control in this game can throw some off. Its not somthing to pick up and play. During the race you\'re canstantly being pushed forward, and crashing into a wall is enough to leave you in dust, If you screw up once, you have to get back on track or else YOU WILL loose the race. You have to know what you\'re doing. It might be bumpy at first, and maybe a bit frustraighting, but give it time and practice, this game can be a blast. But once you do master the games controls, it may become a bit too easy for some players, and all challenge will be lost, becoming a bit boring. That\'s when survival mode comes in. You can participate in battle, gravity ball or a relay race. They are a nice touch, but gravity ball is again too easy if you master the controls. Battle mode is fun, but again, too easy! However, If you have four friends over you\'ll have a blast with relay race. In fact, the games boredom is eliminated during multiplayer. It suprisingly serves as a decent party game. The graphics are nice and detailed. I never experience any slowdown at all, no matter how fast the game goes and it just looks great. Although cutscenes could use some work. Voice acting is...decnt. Better than past Sonic games. Jasson Griffith is not completely terrible. Shocker. The soundtrack is great, but while the two main themes are great, theyr easily forgettable. All in all, Sonic Riders Zero Gravity is not a bad game. If youre getting a 3D sonic game, get this one, and save yourself from disasters like Sonic Heroes. If youre willing to give time, you will enjoy this game.','roymcgeeters','47839154e66832f41d6ae4f33b09bac8ac40c44340bbb3ae436330bd614e7bbe'),(441355,'user',10,'Feb  8, 2021','I played this back in the day.

Now it has been developed into a kick ass RTS as far as I?m concerned. This game isn?t your board game anymore, it has become a real concrete game Atari and TimeGate can hang their hat on There are several modes of play from which gamers can choose from. The first is campaign mode, 24 complete missions on both sides of the war, 12 missions as the Allies, 12 missions as the Axis. This gives the player two campaign options; the opportunity to play out the war as it historically took place, or to play an alternate history version of WWII. It?s a compelling aspect of the game that not many other RTS can boast about. The World War II mode is a meta map version of the Axis & Allies board that lets players move pieces on a turn based map of the world. When a player meets an enemy he has the option to fight out the battle in a quick resolve (dice roll based on relative unit strengths) or in a Real Time Strategy format. Multiplayer can be played on LAN or internet with up to 8 players on varied terrains. Something hardcore guys will really like is that the original map editor used by TimeGate is included in the game. Another awesome feature of the game is the supply lines (the perimeter around your base where units can automatically re-supply and regenerate). All of the buildings at your base are completely mobile, you have the ability to pack up and roll your entire base towards an opponent (with the exception of Air Fields, they must be sold off and repurchased to move). This gives your men the tactical advantage of rolling your supply lines towards the enemy for quicker re-supply. In my opinion, it?s a unique feature that makes the game way more strategic. One of my favorite features in the game is the company control aspect, where by units operate in companies or regiments much like they did historically in WWII. This allows for a LOT less micromanagement of units, which me focus on the larger grand scale battle at hand, which is the idea right? The units of each super power are unique and authentic to their given nation, for example Germany can call for King Tiger Tanks, where as Great Britain can produce Churchill Flamethrower tanks. Another note on authenticity is that each super power lets you control the actual Generals from each power, like Nimitz or Eisenhower from the US. They all have their own special operations as well, such as unloading an A-Bomb with Nimitz on an unsuspecting enemy. The game does however lack a certain visual appeal found in several other fall releases. I found the zoom options and camera angles to be limiting; however the overall quality is not without merit and the games core gameplay more than makes up for its visual weaknesses. Another issue with the game is the AI and game mechanics found in World War II mode. The meta-map AI is more of a ?punish your mistakes? rather than a strategic opponent, kind of pesky if you ask me. The meta map also only allows the play to invade into one occupied territory in a given turn, which makes conquering the map entire more tedious moving into one area at a time. As both a PC strategy gamer and a fan of the original Axis & Allies, I was excited about Atari and TimeGate studios combining the two into a dynamic real time strategy game and have been impressed with the results to say the least. The game is obviously more RTS then conventional A&A gameplay, but for anyone who expected different, there are certain aspects you will still enjoy. It?s a true old fashioned beer and pretzel game. Here is my breakdown: Graphics: 7.5 Visually appealing, yet not as polished as some of the other RTS titles out this fall. Difficulty: 8.0 AI in the game adapts to situation based on players movement, however lacks strength in several areas, primarily WWII mode. Single Player: 8.5 Single player campaign mode faithful to some of the historical battles of WWII. However, WWII mode lacks the true A&A feel and gameplay mechanics. Multiplayer: 9.0 Great experience, play against friends as one of 20 generals in a number of maps. The game fully utilizes the GameSpy Arcade arena and ranking system. Sex Appeal: 8.0 I really enjoy WWII mode and have had lots of fun with the campaigns. I could see this game staying on my hard dive for an extended amount of time. OVERALL: 8.5 I enjoy this game and haven?t seen other reviewers do it justice. It is a surprising star of this RTS fall line up and highly recommended.','TimD.','478a7c0b6c12934a16f2796eff625fae9c0ba1ba1a0ad095190c202055e4ce3e'),(441393,'meta',87,'Not Defined','Has a steeper learning curve than \"Kohan 2,\" and that may turn fans of that series off.

I still find this game fun, occasionally even more so than the original. Now, before I get email bombs and viruses sent my way, let me explain... In certain ways, this game is actually more challenging than the first...that\'s right. CHALLENGING...I don\'t give a crap what the Daily Raidar says either. The only reason they don\'t find it challenging is because they have no rhythm. If they did, they\'d be able to utilize JUST COMMANDS...YES, JUST COMMAMDS.... Let me explain...everyone understands that in order to progress through the game, you must input the suquence of arrows given, and then press the given shape button given and again and again yada yada...BUT, an improvement in this game is that there\'s actually a way to gauge just how WELL you can judge the fourth beat...JUST COMMANDS. In the old bust a groove, there was just a marginal room for error for when exactly you would judge the fourth beat. Sometimes, the button you pressed wasn\'t pressed EXACTLY on the fourth beat, but it was okay, the game was nice and understood... HOWEVER, in BAG2, The game actually \'rewards\' you for hitting the command EXACTLY on the beat. By hitting the command exactly on the fourth beat, you get access to more challenging arrow combination sequences, allowing for a more exciting, challenging, and just plain fun to watch game, whereas if you don\'t execute them well enough, the game assumes you just don\'t play well enough and restricts you to simpler combos...COUGHDAILYRAIDARCOUGH... In addition, there are many little things in the game that add to the pleasure. In BAG, the better you danced, the more events occured in the background. The same feature returns, but this time the actions and event are even zanier and funnier than the original! Who wouldn\'t be freaked out by a police car flying through the air in Kelly\'s stage, or just be taken aback by a rocket slamming into Comet\'s suchi bar sign? Touches like this make the game for fun and amusing, and gives players who find their dancer\'s moves repetitive (DAILY RADAR) some eye candy, or an interesting distraction, distractions which add to the game playability and challenge. I must admit however that it is more fun to play with other people, especially given the stage events and actions. When playing with other people, it\'s more fun to work toward initiating those wild and crazy moments, or just plain neat little gimmicks that make the game just a little bit sweeter in some aspects. For instance, for players who don\'t know this cause they suck and just gave up too soon, in Heat\'s stage, the better you dance, the longer you stay riding on th crane cart, and even find secret rooms. A similar event occurs in almost every stage. The most awesome background events occur when the three collumns of colored blocks are stacked up equally, which again is accomplished by dancing you character\'s ass off. Okay, music...okay, so maybe it\'s not as cool as the first one. But, maybe if people would STOP comparing this game to it\'s predescessor, they might realize that this game stands as it\'s own fun entity. Besides, it\'s cheap, what reason do you have NOT to get it? (AND NO, it doesn\'t suck...) If you have any other questions, email me.

Like the first it has a really good story. However, the story is also the same thing at start. I know the game get\'s more interesting as you go on, but it mostly the same. The story is still good to say the least. The gameplay is a different story. The gameplay is almost the same as the first game. All of the problems still remain. Some mini games where added here, but they do not really add anything too the game. The only real thing added to the game is that added outlaw missions; where, the dungeon ends with a boss fight. however, the game is still fun through. The game looks better then the first game with more detail. The music is a step up and sounds up to date; however, the music itself is just ok. There are a few good tracks here and there at least. Overall as a sequel it fails as it improves little over the first game. As a game itself it\'s great.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the dub voices are abysmal and totally inappropriate. The controls are unresponsive and not at all intuitive, and the missions seem either mindless or impossible, with no space in between. The \'targeting system\' doesn\'t even succeed in keeping you locked on a target and letting you move around, but instead it breaks targeting at the slightest provocation as your mobile suit zips wildly around the confusing and bizarre battlefield, which for some reason has been covered with spherical lines and marks. Furthermore, unlike the superior AEUG vs Titans, your \'allies\' give you little support and in fact often prove to be your undoing as they fly off randomly into space and do nothing useful, leaving you to be blasted into space dust by your foes, who all simultaneously converge on your spot. Couple this with the \'helpful\' bridge crew screaming at you every time you or they get hit, and you have one of the most deeply unfulfilling games ever created for any system, but certainly one of the worst in the prolific line of Gundam games. This is one to avoid unless you\'re willing to spend literally days accustomizing yourself with the horrible controls that seem fully intent on getting you blown up. Pick up AEUG vs Titans instead; even if they never translate it to English (which I\'m hoping will never happen since this game was butchered by its hideous English voice acting) its play control is ten times more intuitive at least, and it\'s much more fun to play. A high count of mobile suits doesn\'t really make me care about Encounters in Space, since the interesting pilots weren\'t included...just the pathetic, whiny, unlikable non-entities from 0079, with a few from 0083 peppered around for interest.

The lock on system wasn\'t all I had hoped for, and it was hard to use. The main problem with it was that the main targhets were hard to lock on to, especially targets that you needed to kill quickly (Anavel Gato ace pilot mode >:{) I often found myself killed by mobile suits that I didn\'t knew were there. But maybe that was a little bit of incompetence n my skills too. Also, some levels are just too hard, especially, when you need to get an A or S rank to get mobile suits. Also the rating system is really weird. I get an S when I get hit 10 times a minute, but a D when i leave battle unscathed. I don\'t get it. Lastly, I request more Zeta, Char\'s Coutnerattack, Wing, Seed, and G gundam suits. I was disappionted when I figured out there are only 6 alternate universe suits, and only 1 0080 gundam (NT1).

Sure, the anime sequences and mobile suits you can pilot here are quite awesome, (Though I thought they could have put more emphasis on series OTHER than 0079 and 0083) but the gameplay is less than impressive. My least favorite thing is the horrid lock-on system, which is SUPPOSED to first lock on the target closest to you, and then each successive target according to distance. However, I find myself getting hit with a beam sword if I rely on that. Locking on to essential targets, i.e. cruisers that have to be destroyed before leaving the target area to complete the mission, should be a whole hell of a lot easier and given priority (Since it IS for mission completion). The control scheme is difficult to get used to, and you can not make custom adjustments to remedy this; there are 3 control schemes, and you like \'em or lump \'em, pretty much. The two modes of combat are inside of sphere and free course going straight. The second is my favorite, as it somewhat resembles games like StarFox.

There are hundreds of quests that are interesting.The game does have a couple of weak points.

The game also allowed players to allocate their own stat points, of which three were given per level. Also added was the ability to block by holding the R button, and also to energy block by holding the B button while blocking. Using the energy block slowly drains the user\'s energy gauge. Both techniques greatly decrease the amount of damage that is received from attacks. The game also added various other features such as fusions and the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan 3.

Machines control the streets and few people are able to survive the tyranny of Skynet, forcing the few survivors to meet and try to organize the response at the instigation of some soldiers who still believe. With its neat atmosphere and close to the movies, this is the only good thing that we recognize at Terminator Resistance. The result is not really convincing. We are thrown into fairly open levels in which we have the opportunity to complete quests and secondary objectives while making sure to get rid of the robots that hang around the city or on the contrary to dodge them taking advantage of the stupidity of AI for to hide. You will also be able to use decoys to distract from the kind of four-legged vacuums that wake up to electrocute you if you get too close to them ... And you\'ll have fun, too, by hacking the enemy cannons, it\'s always better than facing them with live ammunition!

You spend a ridiculous amount of time fighting giant ants, insects and weird things in caves, jungles and canyons and other things more fitting for Diablo, Baulders Gate or Gauntlet Legends. That is not x-men. Another thing, because of the pair up between the brotherhood and the x-men, there are no good villians in this game. The four horsemen suck, Vortex? Lame. The only decent fight in the first half of the game is at the end of Act 2. They start you off with 13 characters, which is great if the total was like 30, but its 16. Through two acts you don\'t get any new characters so there is nothing new and refreshing. Not that many of the characters are any good anyway, the only new characters that are any good are almost Magneto and Juggernaut is good. Otherwise you just find yourself playing as the exact same characters, Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler or Iceman. The other problem with this is once you start playing, its hard to go back to an old character because they are so behind on levels. Not that that matters too much, because the game is ridiculously easy no matter what level you play it on. I\'ve never had 1 character die, let alone a game over through three acts. I think the biggest set back is you spend sooooo much time in menus. The leveling up system is atrocious. They should\'ve went with fewer levels with more points gained per level. A level up is meaingless. Yay I get one skill point even though it takes around 20 to cap off any ability! Plus unlike any normal game, they have a little map in the corner, and if you want to see all of it while playing? Nope! It just makes and ENORMOUS zoomed in version of the little section. To see the whole thing you have to go into the menu and hit auto map, which is the same ENORMOUSLY zoomed in map, except you can now move it around. I played this with two friends and we all do our own level ups so we don\'t get stuck with the crap the computer recommends. This takes FOREVER since level ups are so frequent. We finally stopped leveling up our characters until every 3 or so levels. Not to mention each item of the same kind has different statistics. Instead of just making \"weak gear, normal gear, heavy gear\" its all plain gear (except for other rare and uncommon items) and could have a defense modifier of 4 to 15 or more with no indicator on the menu screen unless you sieve through each one (though they are in decending order, I guess). You can\'t hold more than 20 spare items, and thats super annoying when you have to keep selling stuff to make room, a problem they should\'ve fixed from the first game. Don\'t even say its unrealistic, cause its equally as unrealistic to say you can carry around 20 suits of armor with you. As far as I\'m concerned, its either 1 or infinite. That also leads me to the money. I haven\'t spent a dime yet, there\'s no reason to. And they are WAY more generous with the money this time around. I had 30,000+ after the first two acts and still didn\'t buy anything. The story is complete garbage as well. I know in the first game it took away from the multiplayer to have to run around the xmansion (something the menu time in this game drawfs considerably), and the story in the first one wasn\'t great, but c\'mon, most the time you have no idea why you\'re doing anything in this game. Why is it necessary to fight ants and insects in the savage land to save the world from apocalypse? Allegidly you\'re saving a character, but they make one slight mention of that and nothing of the bigger plan. How did the two sides come together anyway? You just start off on the same side. Most cut scenes are just the two sides bickering at one another, or someone making a lewd comment to Jean Gray and having Cyclops get all mad. Lame.

The explorers games had, by far, the best story-line and the most in-depth story line out of any of the mystery dungeon games. On the surface, the game seems like any other bland kids game, but under the surface, of this child-targeted game,  is so much more, which makes this game enjoyable for all ages. The game gives interesting back stories to each character, even to the characters that didn\'t play a big role in the games. The way the plot is presented is really good; there is foreshadowing of many events, which encourages the player to speculate the outcome of the game and to speculate possible theories associated to the games. There is purposefully a lack of information, at times, since the creators are trying to encourage the player to speculate further, which allows the player to have their own perspective on the course of events and their own view over what happened. This game overall is very well made, in terms of story-line, and most of all, the theme tunes are amazing, and some even iconic (for example Temporal tower\'s theme).

The monsters and cities are rendered nicely. The gameplay is acceptable also. It took time to become accustomed to controlling characters that move slower than the more popular games like Morttal Kombat and Soul Calibur 2, but once I got the hang of it, the fights became enjoyable. Yeah, I know people reading this are snickering about how I find the gameplay to be acceptable, however the slower movements allow you to defend yourself more effectively when playing against the computer. My main complaint is the action mode. For my tastes, there should be a different storyline for each monster that you choose. As a bigtime Godzilla fan, I know that some of the monsters are evil and some are not. Thus, the same \"Save The Earth\" story should not be used for say, Megalon or Gigan. This game gets a 7 simply because of how some of my favorite monsters are rendered so well (especially Jet Jaguar).

Division did that by not being the usual one bullet takes you own type of game, and many shooters hated it. But, others who didn\'t mind the typical shooter picked it up and it found it\'s crowd. This game is trying something I haven\'t seen in a  long time and honestly... have very much missed. There are so many games that say stealth is an option and true it can be, but more times than a few and not that there\'s nothing wrong with it, but in games like Metal Gear 5 if I felt trapped I could usually blast my way out with a smile of success. This game forces you to do stealth giving you limited options and if you play too loose you can get certain optional quests cancelled entirely. I learned that when I was trying to rescue some survivors optionally but, due to a lack of stealth I got one of them killed even though I survived so I restarted a chapter to do better. You don\'t feel invincible in this game. Finishing a whole chapter to a point where you can feel like you finally did something right enough to carry on is tiring and I love it. At times being successful in this game makes you feel like a loser but, that\'s war and life at times.I will give this game 10 because I had fun with the game and still do and in the end I felt like Rocky from Rocky 1.

You can\'t mark out enemies without using an \"Enemy sensor\" that you have to craft, and there isn\'t clear indication of whether you are visible. There is no way to take out enemies quietly from behind, but fighting isn\'t an option because enemies are bullet sponges and your guns are inaccurate. These are enemies that are able to stand up just fine after being blasted by an IED and don\'t even bother flinching and stopping their fire when hit with a bullet, at least until you damage them enough to kill them, whereupon their ragdoll comically springs backwards. Sprinting, even for a second, leaves your character winded and unable to even move faster then a jog for a brief period of time and crouching reduces your speed to a crawl. The most insulting thing for me though is the story, I was told that Front Mission, the game this spins off from, had a large amount of Realpolitik, so i expected some of that to carry over.

If not, you\'ll hate it. Really, you\'d think reviewers would have enough of a background in niche gaming to see a game like this for what it is. It\'s a Roguelike (a dungeon crawl with RPG game mechanics. Unlike most RPGs, there much more emphasis on survival and using what comes your way through random item generation, and far less on simply accumulating power). The story is actually well-developed for a Roguelike, and hinges on exploration and experimentation with changes each time the game world resets. This happens upon either death or reaching the bottom o f the main dungeon. Each reset causes a change in the world, as long as you managed to find a way to advance the plot. Nothing is spelled out for you, but so far I haven\'t encountered anything that couldn\'t be figured out through experimentation. On the other hand, there is a genuine sense of mystery to the plot that\'s generally lacking in games. At the end of the day, though, it\'s not a pretty or polished game.

The Wii and Possibly the Ps2 version start with an anime intro that will give you a vague idea of this contents, you start as the \'chosen one\' who is amnesic and does not knows anything about who or what he is, this was just the thing that made me take the bait, moving on you will see nearly everyone is twisted and few are not physically twisted but rather mentally, example are the bagged one, the horned girl as physical twisted mentally is the grave keeper and a few others. Moving on you will see the Archangel who will give you the angelic rifle and warns you to use it against the absolute god (yes i know you were just asked to kill god this shocked me A LOT), once you enter the neuro tower you will start by seeing that the only stable element is the first floor it never changes and it\'s very advised to come armed, so go to the grave keeper and finish his dungeon/tutorial and you will probably have some bones, meat, seeds a coat and a sword. The way of progressing on this game is reaching the bottom of the neuro tower and shot, or embrace the absolute god, the ending sequence for the first games for some is bizarre as hell, so allow me to explain until you trigger a flag in the game the protagonist is asleep so to speak, and is being cloned en masa my dear readers, so it keep going and going until said flag is triggered, afterwards you can start to collect the idea sephiras (their souls so to speak what was their embodiment) and so you will need to keep heading down and down. The Challenge on this game is on 4 points, the first your VIT bar, you need to eat to restore it and level up so you can survive longer on the tower, the second is the items, unless you are able to search and use the orbs you WILL lose all you collected on your current run, enemies will get stronger, but so you will get better equipment. So what still wondering what is this all about? here it is: The archangel conspired with the Dr.Angelus to steal from the Absolute God the ability to feel pain, unable to feel and understand pain the absolute god went crazy and started to unleash the distortion, people slowly began to look what they were inside, then the protagonist comes in, he was part of a double being, conjoined twins after the death of one of the twins the surviving one kept on with his life until he was offered a chance to fuse with the absolute god, yes said being was about to regain what she lost and more become more humanlike, but sadly the archangel had a hand to play on this, he interrupting the ceremony caused the blaze essentially accelerating the distortion and choosing to blame all on the protagonist. All the reason was for the Archangel to get revenge on the absolute god as she stole his sister, he would steal her godhood and embody it within him. The protagonist was to mend things, sadly after you finish the game you learn that it\'s impossible to turn back the hands of the clock, as the blaze truly revealed mankind deepest wishes but as a fix they chose to create a consensus reality were they can try to make the events less Traumatic for mankind. Baroque crude play style is truly the only bad thing that surrounds this game aside from the limit of objects you can take out of the tower. In the end Baroque is an excellent gothic rouguelike game with a deep saddening atmosphere, with a deep reaching story that will make all those hours of suffering worth something, and the game can take up to 50 hours just to finish the story part if you a re patient you can get up to 300+ hours of pure game play!.  Before i forget this game is a re make of the Saturn game known as Baroque and it was originally a FPS not a 3rd person.','Duncan-Idaho','4b46a9ae952aa8583af5250c827a332d447a594fa87ee91d93d955762c8bfcc3'),(443090,'user',2,'Mar  8, 2019','Square shouldn\'t have put their name on this its a travesty that\'s trying to be Metal Gear Solid and failing miserably.','Marti3P','5adb04944638b33a331212d00dc5bfb6fb05c44271357135c3171fb89a6ddb6d'),(443091,'user',0,'Mar 16, 2019','В этой игре сломано все!

But two things will ultimately make or break this game for you.  One, the gameplay is hard AND easy.  About 6 of the 10(ish) gestures can be read by the game if you actually just swing the wiimote(s) forward and to the right.  But, reading the gestures on the hard difficulty level can still prove to be a challenge even if you are \"cheating\" the system this way.  I personally just do the gestures without cheating and find this game to be loads of fun.  The second thing that will make or break the game for you is the soundtrack.  They are all \"electronica\" so to speak.  Now let\'s face it, your not really supposed to \"get down\" with metal, or alot of rap, but if you actually dislike or hate techno, trance, dance, r&B or any other heavily electronic music laden genres, then i would not recommend this for you.  On a side note, i picked up this title after i moved, and, while dieting as well, lost 30 pounds in about 3&1/2 months.  That leads me to one more small criticism.  I\'m now in good enough shape that i need more songs with alot of energy!  All the hardest workout songs compiles a list of about 7.  Although any song on hard is at least a small work out.  Even if your not looking for a workout and just want to play a fun rhythm game i would recommend Helix.','AdamKrasneski','2d7f4889c36bac5f59ed1d50034027ea272ab1fa7479b758f9b78e152b9fcfdb'),(443137,'meta',85,'Not Defined','The game has a ton of real value because there are plenty of songs to unlock, difficulty levels and the price is so low it makes it worth while to pick up even as an impulse purchase.','GameFocus','2d7f4889c36bac5f59ed1d50034027ea272ab1fa7479b758f9b78e152b9fcfdb'),(443138,'meta',88,'Oct 21, 2010','Even if past DBZ games have rubbed you the wrong way, and I know a lot of them have, give this one a shot.

Mercedes-Benz World Racing is simply a great game. Firstly I will tell things that can be considered as minus points. I agree some of them. Thats why I just gave strong 9 and not 10. If you get over these, then you will just enjoy this game. Like I suretanly do! 1. No oncoming traffic or pedestrian. Those few people just stand. But there are lot of flying or floating objects. 2. Drive-through objects. Strange thing this is. You can actually drive through trees and some other objects. Actually it is just fun. It would be only irritating to crash to all of them. 3. Not drive-through object. This is water in some places. Driving in sea is fun. It also makes these amazing surroundings feel even bigger. There are boats and you can drive past them really fast. Or through them. Cars also slide a lot in water. In some watery areas car just drops to the bottom. Well, driving beneath is also fun :). 4. Much of cars that look same. Biggest minus point. There are many cars where you will notice the difference just from the statistics. And some cars that you see in traffic are not here. Newest and some old classic cars are. But I think that some cars from the between have been dropped out. But on the bright side there are consept cars, formula 1 car ?Silver Arrow? and some powerful track cars. 5. 2D trees. These are not actually 2D. They look like 3D, but when you try to look behind these, they just turn with you. Spooky. Didn?t bother me. I thought that it would have bothered me more, but it didn?t. 6. Not for rushers. I think that this is game that is not ment to be rushed through. It is not THAT exiting. It is a long game where you need time. You may even forget it for a while and then come back to it. It happened to me and then I decided to write this review. I found again how great this game is. 7. City level is a little too dark in some places. 8. Artificial intelligence (AI). Competitors don?t make much of mistakes. So you can make some crucial mistake in the end and lose. And when races are long it may bother you. And if you make same kind of mistake somewhere in the middle of the race you can still get a good result. Maybe even win. Despite of this the most important thing stays: if you drive really good from start to end, you will win. Then to the parts that in my opinion are only good. Graphics. Graphics are awesome. I havent\'s seen better graphics in any game. And I have seen many games. Some graphics in other games are great in a different way, but better?, NO. Being able to see so far in these surroundings is something that must be experienced. Graphics are also crisp and colourful. Things that I would like to be in many other games as well! ?Levels? (There is many: Japan, Nevada, Australia, Mexico, Test Centre, The Alps, The City) are huge and varied and give so much freedom. Steep hills, wide open roads, tough curves. And you can drive just about everywhere you can see even between races. Sound. Games music is good. But more important is that music manager uses Xbox?es hard drive. So you can pick also your own music tracks and hear them while you drive. And in random order. Engine sounds are also great. And sounds from the surroundings are also great. So it is your choise how to balance these three. Gameplay. There is a switch in this game where player can adjust gameplay. If arcade kind of play is what you like then you can adjust it to 100% arcade (maybe I will try this also). Or if realism is your choice (my choise) then you can adjust it to 100% simulation. Or maybe 50/50 ?? Or anything between ?? Choise is yours. I am using steering wheels and pedals. And feeling is amazing. There is wonderful inside view choice where you can see hands in a steering wheel and meters. Tip: If you pause the game in this view and wait till the camera starts to pan around the car, you see meters even closer when you continue. I also drive a real car and I can say that this game represents real driving just fine. Although I have to admit that I don?t make my car slide (thing that occurs in this game very often) almost never. And it is also easyer not to keep on the road in this game than it is for real. I?m glad that it is that way around :). Sliding is fun. Making a correct move that straightens a car is really fun. And game also notices this. ?Good slide? appears often (only in written, there is no speech). ?Excellent slide? is much more difficult to gain. Just some of the other great things. Flying objects Why some people are complaining about these? Would it be better not to have them? Well.. NO. Length. There are lot of races in many ?leagues?. And many missions). Free ride. So fun and relaxing just to drive around. Replays. Seeing your (or competitors, you can switch cars) performance in another angle is great. And pause screens. When you pause the replay in that point where car is coming really near (surface camera for example) you can have close-ups that show the true power of Xbox and this game. Cars just couldn?t have been done any better.

So after purchasing the Ps2 Encounters, I knew I had to have the PsP Tactical Assault. My fear was I was going to get basically the same game ported. In some respects I was right and wrong. Right that I still get the behind the ship camera angle, and for the most part I\'m trying to blow the othership up while keeping mine safe. But the similarities stop there. Personally I love Encounters, but for those of you that were a little turned off by its full blown arcade style, then Tactical should fill some of those voids. There are standard Trek scanning, hailing, negotiating, upgrades, more ships, etc. But where Tactical differs is 3 key areas. First, fighting. The action is slower (more realistic IMO) and weapons don\'t just recharge and fire at your trigger fingers will. You need to jockey for position and target one or two specific areas on your enemies ship if you want to win. Firing the first chance you get will only cause you to waste valuable shots. I like this vs Encounters where if you get a lock, the other guy is screwed. Here one volly won\'t do it. You can overcharge weapons for more damage, but still will take several shots to break a specific shield ring. Second crew upgrades. This should be a welcome thing for RPG fans. The upgrade points don\'t come lightly, and as the difficulty of missions increase so will your needs. You\'ll have to decide what is more important, offensive or defensive capabilities. And finally, the universe. Encounters tries to cover them all, Tactical covers only the Kirk era. This is nice because owners of both games will see that we get some ships we didn\'t before like the Excelsior. This is in doubt (fingers crossed) due to the fact that Tactical Assault 2 could, and most likely would cover the Next Generation and beyoned (Deep Space 9, Voyager). The making of a franchise is here, and with 2 solid campaigns and a fun couple skirmish modes this game comes with my highest reconmondation.','McBain17','5f4698df9fa95b37dbdf3b595cca2c7a321bd3ec047ae4af3ecd5747e843c44f'),(443429,'user',9,'Jan 11, 2010','This game provides exactly what the name says \"Tactical Assault\". The game is based off of Star Trek universe tactics and ships. This is not a customisable RPG nor is it supposed to be. Granted it is not as good as other ST games but it is better than some that Paramount has put its logo on. This game does seem repeticious but only because people tend to use the same tactics each time and that does not work. The Klingon campaign offer various situations that call for classic Klingon combat strtagies (similar to the J turn combat of SFB) and user defined understanding of how the Races work in conjunction with each other. There is a rating system that determines what you will do as the game continues and that gives to crew upgrades and what you can do. If you want a ST rpg you will not find it here, but if you want combat tactics this is the game. The only drawback to this game (and others like it) is that combat takes place in a planular field instead of a 360 degree universe.','Phild8vid','5f4698df9fa95b37dbdf3b595cca2c7a321bd3ec047ae4af3ecd5747e843c44f'),(443430,'meta',70,'Nov  8, 2011','Its outward appearance may seem kiddy, but Go Vacation is surprisingly deep for a minigame collection.

I found that the difficulty ramped up fairly quickly, and in the end was unable to complete the missions without some cheats to max out crew skill points. The missions are lengthy at times, which can be difficult if the main advantage of the PSP is on-the-go gaming; I was loathe to stop a mission halfway through (like, twenty or more minutes in) and half to restart next time, but often had no choice. If your PSP experience is more relaxed, it might not be sucha bad deal for you. As production goes, the game is easy to control, graphics are good, has a neat Trek storyline, and a great soundtrack.

With just a few small additions, It could have been the best game of all time. I\'m serious. Basically, its a clone of Star Fleet Battles or Star Fleet Command, but very simplified. I understand the PSP should be simpler than games played on the PC, but this goes too far. Combat consists of moving and firing your weapons, and each race has one single special thing they can do with their ship (like cloaking). That\'s it.I can understand them cutting out stuff like mines, tractor beams, and transporters, but why can\'t I even scan an enemy ship during combat? That doesn\'t make sense (strangely, you can do scans on things in between combats). I also can\'t tell my engineer which systems I want repair first, or do any specific power management, like reinforcing my front shield, for example. Just a couple extra things like that would have gone a long way to adding depth to this game and making it feel like the movies. Another complaint is that the battlefields don\'t have very much room, which will drive you nuts if you are in a small asteroid field and you can\'t go out of it anywhere. Doesn\'t feel much like the vastness of space if you feel boxed in! There are plenty of good points though. The graphics are beautiful and there is a fairly decent variety of ships. There is a campaign with a storyline, or you can just set up a single combat and play. The timeline is also set in the original series, which is great, and each splash screen has a quote from one of the original episodes or movies, which is a nice touch.

It\'s that uncertainty of not knowing the game rules that creates the unnerving play through of this game. One of the lights went off and your clock re winded a few hours? Maybe the light is keeping you from seeing mobile guests. Do you keep getting swarmed by monsters? Maybe that\'s because there is a breach open somewhere.','Cobra007','4bad920f51a9cf6ec63406762fd79ca9f564e66d9ecb9e06607c204f0ab0842f'),(443479,'user',8,'Nov 17, 2013','Incredible atmosphere, excellent art-design, short gameplay and some questionable game design decisions.

The difficulty is too much on the hard side, and to really enjoy it, players will have to set the difficulty on easy or very easy, throwing away the hardcore factor. Of course it won\'t be an accomplishment as finishing it on Normal or higher, but the enjoyment will be higher. From start you are attacked by zombies (some of them wield a shotgun or a machine gun) and believe me, they will resist more bullets than you, even on easy. Getting shot is one of the most annoying things of the game, cause you will loose about half of your entire health bar, and if you get hit by a zombie scratch or biten, you will take less damage but you will be infected with a virus and you will need to pick an antidote ASAP.

Budokai 3 still proves itself to be one of the standout games of its generation still holding its own against many great fighting games of today. Budokai 1 however has not aged as well, it feels sloppy and slow in comparison to the great Budokai 3. The absence of Budokai 2 is also a downfall of the collection as it is named \"Budokai HD collection\". The one thing that did bug me though was the music, entirely new music was used instead of sticking to the original tracks. Though these songs aren\'t bad the take away from the nostalgic feel of the games. Overall this collection is good but feels like a quick cash grab to a franchise that is struggling to stay alive.  Budokai 3 is still great but Budokai 1 feels lacking. The absence of Budokai 2 and the original music do detract from the experience but don\'t entirely destroy the game.

Thanks to those tweaks, a newbie player can provide good competition to an expert or veteran player. My only gripes with this HD Collection are the fact that Budokai 2 is not part of the collection and the music has been changed. However, those two factors are not even close to turn offs, especially seeing as the music was changed due to kenji yamato (the guy responsible for the original music) was accused of plagiarism and in turn fired.

Have you noticed how almost all of the games and movies directed towards kids get bad reviews? That\'s because ADULTS are writing reviews for KID material, almost all of which does not apply to them or is beneath/behind them. Well, i\'m a kid, and i can tell you that this game is awesome. The core gameplay is somewhat simple, and it gets a tiny bit repetitive, but this only helps the game along. At first it seems like the game will be really short. There are six \"dungeons\" plus a battle royale on each level, and there are four levels. However, within each dungeon, there are four floors, each with around one hundred pokemon on it. However, when you beat the fourth floor, there is also a boss pokemon. There are four levels, or ranks. C,B,A,S. When you beat S you unlock a new gamemode that is exactly the same stages only filed with Sinnoh pokemon as opposed to the prior Kanto. When you beat that, you unlock another gamemode. Figure the third one out when you get the game. $15 isn\'t very much, and whether this game is worth it or not, you won\'t really otice that you\'re $15 short. The controls are great, the graphics are wonderful, the game is fast with no lag, and there is no story. But the lack of a story just helps. basically, this game is fun to all pokemon fans, all fans of collecting, all fans of catching em all, all gauntlet fans, and all 100V1 fans. But that is the specific target audience. You could still like it even if you are not one of these things.','nonnikchief','75e618c23a675c2e5edfaade90decf3f9cabfb8b614bae12d7e9b9de6e1d9a6a'),(443543,'user',7,'Nov 21, 2009','Pokemon Rumble is a lot of fun.

You can not evolve pokemon, you can not even level them. You only get two moves per character. The graphics(come on man I know it is only 15 bucks but you could have done better than that) The extreme lack of levels(again this is just lazyness). And last but not least the fact that it does not scale toughness correctly with number of people playing(with one person it is not to hard but with 4 you never die). All that considered it is not a bad game for 15 bucks(specially being a wii game). It is incredibly intuitive, a D-pad and 2 buttons. The different moves I am very pleased with especially taking into account the number of moves you have and the fact that they are very true to the game. Side note disable is actually pretty useful when half the people you fight only have one attack lol. Also they do have quite a few Pokemon to collect and it takes a lot of runs to just see them all so you can put some time in this game. Overall I found I could sit down with a couple friends and just have some fun being able to go thru the game and button mash the crap out of people. You can even have some strategy, for example I was playing with one of my friends and he would use disable and I would thundershock and hopefully paralyze them so they could not even run away (good times) Anyway over all this game is worth it and I would highly recommend trying the FREEEEE demo before you buy it, You will really get a feel for what the game is like. P.S. One more note of annoyance, I should not be able to double slap a Gastly, or easily kill a water pokemon with a fire move. I am really really hoping they come out with a second rumble where they fixed alot of these issues. This has the potential to be a really really fun game.','JamieLand','75e618c23a675c2e5edfaade90decf3f9cabfb8b614bae12d7e9b9de6e1d9a6a'),(443559,'user',6,'Aug 19, 2011','Pokemon Rumble is the second Pokemon spin-off released for WiiWare. The game-play of the game is a big change from previous games. The player control toy Pokemon as they battle other toy Pokemon in a series of linear dungeons and enclosed arenas. The game uses a Wii Remote held sideways. The player starts off with a low-level Pokemon with only one attack at their disposal. By battling wild Pokemon through a number of levels the player collects coins which can be used to buy new attacks or recruit more Pokemon. When the player obtains a high enough level Pokemon, the doors to the Battle Royale room open, where they take on dozens of Pokemon at a time in an enclosed arena. The player must defeat all of the Pokemon in order to rank up, eventually facing much stronger and even Legendary Pokemon. Although it is a nice change to see in a Pokemon game it is not enough to consider it a decent game. The graphics aren\'t well polished, the game-play is too repetitive and Ambrella was being lazy whilst developing the game. The game does a good enough job to give a decent amount of fun, but ultimately this wasn\'t one of the great Pokemon games.','Radeen','75e618c23a675c2e5edfaade90decf3f9cabfb8b614bae12d7e9b9de6e1d9a6a'),(443560,'user',8,'Jun 25, 2014','Pokemon Rumble is a fun cheap game, that not everyone will like. Indeed it is repetitive, if you don\'t like hitting people, & nothing else, but isn\'t that the point of these types of games? The Pokemon look good, using models from my Pokemon ranch to save money. But the Pokemon are missing the shine texture, like they do in Rumble Blast, they just look, kinda awkward. When you kill Pokemon, you get a set 1, 10, or 100 money coin, depending on the level, & what the Pokemon is. When you kill a pokemon you have a chance of capturing it, but its random, so getting a pokemon that you really want, is really hard. You can also get pokemon by buying one from the store, which is ALSO random, you never know on what pokemon you\'ll get! Finally, you can ALSO get pokemon by sending of a certain array of pokemon, which just SUCKS! But to combat that, you can only hold a certain amount of pokemon. The moves you can buy are also random as well. So in short, everything random in this game sucks! There is only 2 generations of pokemon in this game: Gen.1, & gen, 4 or 5, i\'m not a pokemon expert. To get all 3 legendarys, ie: Palkia & ect... you need to get certan pokemon, but the main one is Dragonite, the HARDEST pokemon to catch, and you need him for all 3, and to get mewtwo, you need to sell all 3 of the legendaries, so if you want to complete the \"Pokedex\" you need to catch dragonie 6 TIMES! Trust me, he is NOT easy to catch AT ALL! & to top it all off, when you see him as a boss, there is a SLIM chance you will catch him. But, if you like this game as much as me, you won\'t mind doing the same level over, & over, & over again, but the same 6 levels, yes SIX for EVERY rank, & EVERY difficulty for that rank will get repetitive, you you like to nitpick.','SirKirbyThe4th','75e618c23a675c2e5edfaade90decf3f9cabfb8b614bae12d7e9b9de6e1d9a6a'),(443561,'meta',70,'Nov 10, 2012','This collection won\'t make everyone happy, but for the people it tantalizes the wait for next year\'s new movie will be a little more bearable.','Gamers\' Temple','846cf24d54319e96a6746c843ceaac5a07458e16608a6758ba84494cd33bcb9b'),(443562,'meta',68,'Nov  7, 2012','Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD made me realize something: All I ever really wanted was a DBZ fighting game.

I never did get into Samurai Warriors, but that could be due to trying to start with the Empires games, which aren\'t my style (cumbersome interface, false sense of strategy). All that being said, I find Warriors Orochi to be nearly unplayable. I\'ve never had an issue with the difficulty of these games before, but even with more-than-reasonable leveling you are overpowered rather than superpowered. The appeal of these games has always been one character who can (beyond reason) plow through hundreds of opposing warriors. In Orochi, you are battered by minions and rendered immobile by officers constantly. It leaves you with a feeling of helplessness and frustration - it took me five tries to beat even the second (one star difficulty) battle. Besides the combat, I find the menu system to be completely unintuitive. Some nice options from the previous games are incorporated, such as leveling weapons, but for the most part having to organize/combine weapons or officers appears to be pointless and time-consuming.','TylerD.','c2c595b46d33098bb1496d663a161061e9e07106dd2a192754b5af517512041c'),(443611,'user',9,'Sep 23, 2007','Ignore the critics, this game is the only DW/SW game you need until DW 6.

It is somewhat slow at the start, but later picks up just fine. It is not one of those new school games that you play without brain and using two controls. It is more demanding, but if you give it enough time, you will be rewarded. Aside from questionable voiceovers and some smaller glitches (most are already fixed in patches), this is a true gamers game. There is no multiplayer, but singleplay is very well composed. Interesting plot, unique characters in the story, vast designed space and a sense of a real living universe. Also, if you dislike the story, you can avoid it completely and enjoy all the space sectors on your own. Possibilities are numerous, roaming around. fighting pirates or members of the official military, trading, mining. Once you earn some credits and experience, you can purchase larger and more powerful ships, and then further customize them using many different ship\'s and weapon\'s systems.

The zones still feel dead in general when compared to WoW’s where you’ll see NPC’s actually doing things such as bears hunting fish or predators hunting prey and in general FF14 zone design seems to be nothing more than ‘this is the bear area and over there’s the wolf area and this final area is the bird area and the mobs are just all walking back and forth in their little zone’ and doodads just seem thrown into the game world and rarely are blended in.','leviathonlx','ce9ce00fa038c96b27ec1b5624ac628014e53412c75c9cdf651401340f4e04b5'),(443738,'meta',70,'Not Defined','Despite some flaws, Aragorn\'s Quest is an engaging adventure across a well-realized version of Middle-earth.','GameSpot','e3829cc861e1a179080edb77b916d46eb665c61d8db2098e1efb175ce816953d'),(443739,'meta',70,'Not Defined','Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest is fun and satisfying, if just a tad repetitive action adventure with good fan service to those of you that love the Tolkein novels and Peter Jackson films.','IGN','e3829cc861e1a179080edb77b916d46eb665c61d8db2098e1efb175ce816953d'),(443740,'meta',70,'Not Defined','The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn\'s Quest isn\'t that bad of an adventure game.

But not for long... Dead Man\'s Chest feels very much unfinished. Why? Well, first of all, you can see through textures, camera is not precise and it sticks every time in a corner where you can\'t see the horde of enemies coming to you, every enemy, from pirates to natives, fights absolutely the same, graphics could be better, although they are a bit on the colorful side, and the only bright spot is Jack Sparrow himself ( Voiceover and animation ). Voiceovers are great, but only of the main characters, others are repetitive beyond normal standards. This game just goes to prove that games made by movies suck, albeit few others. Oh, I almost forgot, yopu will not see even a scene from the movie because every animation is made with the in game engine.

It\'s actually a pretty good timekiller and with a friend, this game can be a real blast. However, this game does suffer some serious faults.

It is to some extent but over time, it just feels like you\'re fighting the same battle over and over and over. In addition to that, you\'ll begin feeling like there\'s hardly much of a map to play with. China begins to feel pretty small which is funny considering how big it actually is.

Sure, it had a few annoyances, but overall, it was fun. The sequel, however, doesn\'t do it for me. All the shops are built into an awkwardly designed cyberspace-like map, where everything is spread out. Features that were once easy to access in the first game, like the save feature which was located in the living quarters before, is now several feet away from said location. There are no familiar characters to make it feel like a sequel. There is no story connection with the predecessor, making it feel more like a different game with the same gameplay. Lower bosses (like D Rank), who should be weak and easier to kill than the later ones, are now ridiculously overpowered and can only be beaten by putting in an invincibility code. The Animal Chips (now called ICs; Intelligent Chips) now have Health Bars, for some reason. Now, you have to spend a lot of money just to keep the Chip in working order. There are more arenas to battle in, but now you have to spend a lot of cash to get to them. As a result, you can\'t afford to lose any matches. That brings up another problem: money is much harder to get in this game when most of your opponents have much better weapons than you do. It doesn\'t help the fact that your weapons themselves tend to break faster than before, oftentimes resulting in you having to retreat more often than you\'d like to. In conclusion, I wouldn\'t recommend this title. Stick with the much better Phantom Crash.','PKMN37','fb4a18b81f41713f7bc60e49df3c7bc842fb2dbf4e24165c1ec4ee07c9f92464'),(444093,'user',9,'Mar 14, 2016','Recommended to: Armored Core fans(especially of the arena) primarily.

INSERT INTO `review` VALUES (444108,'user',8,'Aug  9, 2009','First my take, then my 10 year old son\'s take. We bought an Xbox 360 very, very recently and loaded up on a few essential dad-kid games before leaving the store, unconcerned about reviews or seeing gameplay in action. For me, a few red flags were raised during the opening sequence and later in the game was a bit bored by the nighttime werehog elements but so far have not been troubled by them beyond fact they are different. It is certainly true that I would have passed on the game had I see those elements in action at the gamestore or online, and especially if they were not plastered with the Sonic brand. My son, on the other hand, is still thrilled. In fact, he preferred the slower and what he called \"Kingdom Hearty\" gameplay as werehog Sonic, and felt more like he was progressing in a game with a character he could build. Speeding through levels hje gets flustered and disinterested, gains and loses coins at random, and has no reason to feel nostalgic. His first exposure to Sonic in game form, beyond images of older Sega titles in magazines, was actually Super Smash Bros (Wii). (His first exposure to Mario was Galaxy, as well.) I feel that this Sonic game is a fantastic balance. The developers have gotten their slaps on the wrist in sales and are making up for things bit by bit to classic gamers by releasing DLC, but I don\'t think they\'ve put a foot wrong here. Another thing to consider about my review: we live in Japan, and the Japanese release of the game is in both Japanese and English. Perhaps so are other versions. This makes the game particularly exotic to one or both of us, as having the ability to log in under two gamertags with save games in two languages and spice up the experience. It\'s rather like watching a classic Disney film get remade in a foreign language -- interesting and bizarre and much easier to accept.','rbee','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444109,'user',9,'Dec 11, 2010','Simply a fun game!

Yes, it can be a pain to keep having to switch between night and day, but playing as a werehog felt awesome especially since it made this sonic game also into a kid friendly God of War game! :) This is a great Sonic game is definately worth picking up for any sonic fan!','hydeks','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444110,'meta',70,'Not Defined','With Mech games being a rare commodity these days, this mech sim provide decent action and customizations, albeit being repetitive in the long run.','DarkStation','fb4a18b81f41713f7bc60e49df3c7bc842fb2dbf4e24165c1ec4ee07c9f92464'),(444111,'meta',65,'Not Defined','Regardless of the number of variations in outfitting, the combat remains simple and unimpressive.','WHAM!

This time around it\'s a point and click game where you move from room to room with the most generic map system I\'ve ever seen. The ratio between gameplay and pressing X through dialogue is about 20 to 80 percent, sometimes I almost forgot there was any interactivity. The sections you do play are very easy and don\'t require much thought at all. To add insult to injury, everywhere you go looks the exact same as everywhere else with only a few exceptions, so exploration feels pretty gimmicky. They literally use the same drawing for most of the hallways and even most of the rooms, they\'re just mirrored like we wouldn\'t know the difference. The story is equally shallow, at least for most of the scenarios. The first 7 chapters of the game don\'t even take place in the official canon of the story, and even though the voice acting and writing stay very true to the first game, the stories aren\'t nearly as motivating. 6 out of 7 of them end horribly no matter what choices you make, which betrays what was so good about the story of the first. The sense of urgency when you or a friend are in danger dies pretty quickly once you realize that the characters are only there as bait for torture porn.

Of course, this means there is much more reading than in the first game, and frankly, some parts do tend to drag on for a while, but overall, the writing is still superb and the scary, gross moments are still present. Overall, I recommend it only if you were a big fan of the first game, as it is not a direct sequel, and more of alternate scenarios playing out before, during and after the events of the first game. So, unless you are very familiar with the original game, you will be very confused. The only reason I am giving it a 9 and not a 10, is because the visual novel aspect was a bit less interesting than the exploration aspect in the first game.

I never thought Sonic team could possibly get so close to perfection. Why is it so good? A couple things really, first the new graphics engine for the next gen consoles was used beautifully with great looking cutscenes, levels, and hub-worlds. Now to the music... Absolutely amazing with fantastic pieces by composer Tomoya Ohtani and Kenichi Tokoi\'s pieces shine throughout this game especially some of the hub-world music. Now to the Gameplay... Damn fun, the daytime missions are a great deal of fun they\'re fast fun and really well crafted, the sense of speed and controls are nearly perfect here. The only problem with the controls in my eyes were the air boost always got in the way of me trying to do a homing attack but other than that very smooth. Now the Night-time missions... They are a blast to play, YEAH these were the missions I sometimes found myself enjoying more than the daytime. The controls were once again smooth and they really emulate what it\'s like to be a beast being unleashed especially when you level up and learn new combos, writing about just makes me want to go play right now. Overall this game was just too underappreciated by both fan and critics and it really deserves better this is in my eyes the most polished and near perfect sonic game just give it a chance, and unlike Sonic Generations the day time isn\'t always \"hold X to win the game\" the game actually takes a lot more skill.

A very polarizing game amongst fans. Some say it\'s one of the good Sonic games, others say it\'s one of the worst. I\'d say it\'s just like the whole theme of the game. Day and night, light and darkness, Sonic and Werehog Sonic. Each have their good parts and bad parts. This game is split into two gameplay segments, daytime Sonic and nighttime Sonic. Daytime is the considerably better half. Extremely fast boost gameplay, it\'s in my opinion the fastest we have ever seen Sonic to date. It\'s super fun and exciting to blaze through stages with exhilarating speed. The game also introduces a leveling system which allows you to level up daytime Sonic\'s speed meter and ring meter. Allowing you to go faster and hold more rings repsectively. That\'s about it for daytime Sonic when it comes to leveling. Now for nighttime Sonic. Leveling up Werehog Sonic let\'s you level several different stats. From combos, health, shields, and unleashed. Combos gives you more attacks. Health let\'s you take more hits before you die. Unlike daytime Sonic where it\'s ring based. Shields let you block more attacks and for longer without it breaking. And Unleashed let\'s you stay in Unleashed form longer. Which the form itself let\'s you deal more damage and move faster for a short time. During the actual gameplay segments the game slows down drastically, both in gameplay and preformance at times. You control Werehog Sonic which the game turns into an action game. You then spend the next 20-40 minutes mashing X or Y until you get to the end of the stage. You also solve light puzzles and platforming. Which I don\'t like. Controlling Sonic while platforming in these stages makes me super nervous since grabbing onto ledges is a bit finicky and your jump isn\'t the best either. I don\'t hate these stages as much as others but I feel like they were added for a few reasons. One is because I feel like Sega looked at what was popular at the time and saw that God of War and Devil May Cry were doing well so they decided to mimic that. And my other reason is because they needed a new mechanic to pad out the game and the Werehog fit that role perfectly. There are also a few other things that pad out the lenght of the game. Such as needing 120 Sun Medals and 80 Moon Medals to beat the game. Eggman Land being an hour long and so on. The most likely reason for all these things was more than likely the short development time this game had. Coming out two years after Sonic The Hedgehog 2006 this game was more than likely quickly made to try and get Sega back on their feet after the disaster of 06. But looking at it from that perspective. It\'s quite impressive what Sega did in about two years of development time. The world itself is pretty neat and diverse. Covering many cultures we don\'t see all to often in media. Each stage and is based around the theme of the segment of the world you are at. I especially love the music from each of the places. That\'s one good thing Sonic will always be known for. No matter how bad the game the music will always be better. But, the music is super great. The Werehog gets more chill variations of the daytime themes, with it\'s music being more jazzy to match the slower gameplay while Sonic has more upbeat energetic music to match the faster gameplay. My personal favorite theme is Shamar at night. The story is alright. Eggman fires a laser that breaks apart the earth, in hopes of releasing Dark Gaia, so he can use it to take over the world and build his own amusement park in his image. Sonic goes to stop him as usual, but Eggman drains the power of the chaos emeralds, turning Sonic into Werehog Sonic. And the story goes on from there. I think it\'s fine. There\'s a twist near the end which isn\'t too big of a surprise. But it\'s fine. Overall I think Sonic Unleashed is a very strange experimental game. Stuck in this weird limbo of being a good and bad Sonic game. It has its good moments and bad ones. But I don\'t think it\'s as bad as everyone gives it credit for. I would recommend giving it a try if you have the chance','Akira_The_Kat','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444265,'user',1,'Sep  8, 2010','Good game with one massive problem. The game is actually registered as an entirely different game to the normal version on the same console. They completely split the playerbase and the amount of people to pick up the colonies edition is so few it will always be hard to play online. Myself and a friend didnt realise this was the case. We heard the multiplayer was pretty good and played the multiplayer demo which is still on Live. We assumed colonies was like any other special edition and just included the download content from before. One of us bought colonies and the other bought a pre owned copy of the original only to find we had the same game but couldnt play each other. Seems like such a huge mistake to make for one of the worlds biggest publishers Capcom. Its not worth the hassle.','Goatbot','849c83c25918a6dd4b8a000477bd6080b164862f082c53dbcda8f0f278fb97e6'),(444266,'user',10,'Jan 30, 2021','Sonic unleashed é simplesmente o melhor jogo do Sonic já feito.

The game features Sonic only with some pretty exciting stages that are great but sometimes have a strange pace because of its excessive amount of obstacles in it. However, the werehog experience is a more slower sonic focused on a mediocre combat. The combat gets better when you achieve more combos, but it gets very tiring because the game puts too many combat moments and even less platforming in this stages. The werehog stages can sometimes be great, other times decent, mediocre or even at times awful. Yet, the overall concept of the werehog in general feels out of place and unnecessary for the franchise. I would have rather used a new character that was a wolf and would do those tricks, instead of thinking that somehow Sonic becomes this thing. Luckily, the xbox 360 version features a much more exciting gameplay than the wii version because of a better speed in sonic levels and better controls in the werehog battles that make me give it a higher score.','Sonicphoto','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444276,'user',5,'Nov 28, 2008','Don\'t listen to the reviews.

The visuals are terrific with settings based on real world locations, a great lighting engine, and aesthetically pleasing scenarios that add much more to the experience. The hub worlds are very vivid and add to the world traveling theme of the game, where you can explore the beautiful valleys and cities, talk with cartoony humans from all over the world that have interesting side stories and missions, and a lot more. The stages are divided between day time and night time stages. In the day stages you take control over sonic and speed trough levels that are mostly based on reaction skills. In the night stages, sonic transforms into a \"werehog\", which leads to a slower paced gameplay focused on combat, platforming and minor puzzles.  I understand this isn\'t what people would expect for a sonic game, but from a techinical point of view, it\'s pulled off very well and gives a good balance to the gameplay. The werehog has an interesting combat system, with a huge arsenal of combos and other skills, that can be upgraded or unlocked, and the later levels do get pretty challenging with the platforming and fighting, even trought i thing it has too much of those segments where you have to balance on \"tigh ropes\" and his levels can get way too long at times. But overall it\'s your above-average beat\'em up platformer. The story is also interesting, with a more serious tone but also more light hearted moments and amazing cgi\'s. The fighting music from the night stages get too repetitive but other than that, the soundtrack is great. I found the boss fights to be very creative and use the game\'s mechanics very well, except maybe for the fight with gaia colossus vs. dark gaia, which requires some weird timing...guess you have to play to understand. As far as my english skills go, I don\'t think I can elaborate on more than this(I also don\'t want this review to be too long), but sonic unleashed altrhough far from perfect does a lot of things right, and feels like a well-polished sonic game that you should give a try.','Ultra22','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444283,'user',9,'Jun 29, 2008','Beautiful game to be seen in motion.

The daytime stages are very fast and completely redone to make a great Sonic game experience. Enemies only hurt you when they attack you, rail-switching locks onto available rails even when they curve off and the homing attack comes with a lock-on graphic to help players land attacks without flying off into the distance by mistake. Sonic\'s \'Sonic Boost\' lends him the ability of high-speed when you want it and the ease and satisfaction of smashing enemies at the speed of sound, Quick-step helps greatly in avoiding incoming objects but I feel the Sonic-Drift is annoyingly too slippery in turns. Despite the controversy with the Night-time Werehog levels, it offers a new fighting experience that tends to run on for a long time and tedious when you don\'t level-grind stats well. The second werehog level is downright difficult for first-time players and my god, the checkpointing they did for the Werehog levels was unbearable! The town hubs used in the game work out pretty good! Obviously based something like Sonic 06\' but less crappy, the NPC townspeople look and emote like characters you would see in Pixar movies, very emotional at times to fit the text dialogue. The voice-acting for Sonic Unleashed has said to be \'improved\' though I honestly couldn\'t tell the difference, it\'s okay to me, though Chip has a voice that\'s very different I must say. One big drawback is the medals system they put in place, requiring to collect Sun medals to unlock Daytime stages and Moon medals for night-time stages, for those trying to get to the end quickly will end up getting stuck because they didn\'t slow down to find them hidden throughout the stage, and towards the end of the game, the requirement gets irritatingly high. It would\'ve been more suitable to just make it optional for extra powers or unlockables instead. Despite the crap reviews this game gets, I feel it\'s only because the Werehog wasn\'t just a strange gimmick but was poorly executed, much like a downgraded version of \'God of War\'. What Sonic Team did with the Town hubs and especially the daytime gameplay was truely spectacular, it could\'ve toned down the Quick-time events bit but a whole game involving the daytime gameplay would be a true revival of the Sonic series. In short: Daytime levels rocks, please do more. Werehog levels are occasionally fun when you max stats but so very tedious. It has some gems of awesome Sonic gaming but just has a whole load of boring crap strewn around it.','litb007','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444287,'meta',80,'Not Defined','As a comprehensive and thoroughly enjoyable multiplayer package, however, Lost Planet Colonies is well worth seeking out for its refreshed online servers and distinct new play modes.','GamesRadar+','849c83c25918a6dd4b8a000477bd6080b164862f082c53dbcda8f0f278fb97e6'),(444288,'meta',80,'Not Defined','Probably the best budget game we\'ve ever seen...You\'d have a frozen heart not to love it.

I totally love Sonic Unleashed at what it tries to do.

I would love to give the game the score it deserves had the Werehog not take over literally more than 50% of an average walkthrough for a casual gamer all in such. Many people are very divided on this game and I\'m fine with that. Some people may like the Werehog while others don\'t and I\'m fine with that. The problem with Sonic Unleashed that can easily be avoidable due to people\'s different perspectives when playing the game is that Sonic the Werehog gets too much playtime in a game that otherwise focuses more on speed.

OK, I will admit - it\'s a step forward from 06, but that doesn\'t automatically mean it\'s great. What people overlook so damn much is that: 1) The MAJORITY of the game is played as the Werehog, which is absolute CRAP. I can\'t believe people can be so blind and brand this as \'such a great game\' and yet they themselves had a horrible time with this disgusting gameplay style. 2/3 of the game is played as this piece of crap, which automatically makes it a bad game. But no, SEGA had to make it even WORSE! Let\'s go deeper, shall we? 2) Surprisingly, the incredibly overrated daytime stages are bad as well. At first, you\'ll be in love with them, because of their insane speed, seemless gameplay and literally effortless fun. But once you decide to play them again... the fun is gone. Why? Because you\'re constrained in a tight hallway surrounded by invisible walls and doing nothing but plough through everything at breakneck speed with no thinking required. I really don\'t understand what the hell is so fun about this turdfest. It\'s WAY too easy and gives nothing for the player to do but RUN. Sounds fun, right? 3) Pace... ugh. Remember the good old days, where simply beating a stage would lead you onto another? Well, Sonic Unleashed throws all of that away and forces you to explore hubworlds, talk to random people, wait through loading screens to access ANOTHER hubworld and as soon as you reach the level gate, you\'re prompted by this annoying pest known as \'Chip\' that you haven\'t collected enough sun or moon medals. This means that you have to replay the crap you\'ve just played to collect more medals hidden throughout the stages in order to progress. It enhances replay value, but then again, why \'enhance\' replay value on something that nobody would enjoy (well, at least the Werehog, anyway)? It\'s just a stupid gimmick to pad the game out. OK, so, I don\'t like this game, which is pretty clear. But is there ANYTHING that this game did right? Hell yes. 1) The graphics are stunning, especially in HD. It makes the pain more bearable to see all these pretty landscapes that you wish you could explore but can\'t because the stupid game won\'t let you. 2) The music is fantastic. The daytime music is usually more fast and upbeat, featuring some catchy tunes packed with variety. These just give me a feel-good feeling. The nighttime music, on the other hand, is much slower, somewhat orchestral and relaxing. Personally, I prefer the daytime music, but there\'s no denying that both types of track are just great. 3) While I do NOT like the daytime stages, I can praise it for at least one thing: the technical achievement. Even though ploughing mindlessly through everything is NOT my kind of fun, you\'ve got to admit that it\'s pretty darn stunning to see Sonic run that fast with incredible graphics to boot. There\'s not a single slowdown issue while doing any of this, either. There are a few framerate dips, however, espeically in the later stages. So, all in all, I would recommend Sonic Unleashed ONLY to diehard Sonic fans who want to \'check it out\'. Otherwise, (send me death threats for saying this, I don\'t care) Sonic Unleashed is a smelling piece of crap and it should never have been released in such a state.','SawnikAdventure','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444330,'meta',40,'Not Defined','A teeth-grindingly stupid premise belies a few okay gameplay ideas.

On the one hand you have some of the best level design and platforming action the series has ever seen, and on the other we find an absurd beat-em-up that has no place in a Sonic game. To focus on the Daytime stages for a minute, they are fantastic but not without their flaws, you can be blitzing around europe at insane speeds and getting second-perfect button presses to keep your speed going then, bang, you\'ve hit a wall where no warning has been given. These moments are few and far between but they are noticably more common in the later levels. Though even with this slight problem I still find these levels to be a great way to pass the time. Seamlessly switching from a blisteringly fast 3D view into a side on sidescrolling section is a sight to behold and it works incredibly well, providing for fans of both the modern and original games.','Kazu','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444366,'user',5,'Nov  3, 2011','A huge letdown for my Sonic fanboyness.

The day time stages all have amazing level design. They bring a great sense of speed, platforming  and difficulty. And to top it off, we get introduced to the boost. With this, sonic can go at blazing speeds. However, at night, sonic turns into a werehog and loses his speed. Instead, he is given an abundance of strength used to kill the dark gaia enemies spawning in stages at night. Also, he is given an better platforming controls and exploration. The exploration technique allows him to collect sun and moon medals across each stage. The medals are a vital part in the game and are used to unlock stages in the game to progress further. Anyway, the night stages also have amazing level design too. Another thing about the werehog is that he has RPG elements. This allows him to upgrade his life bar, his strength to become stronger, his combat to learn new moves, his shield to make that stronger (I wouldn\'t upgrade it until near the end of the game) and his unleash mode to make that last longer. His unleashed mode makes him faster, stronger and invincible. Daytime sonic also has RPG elements too. One to upgrade his speed and the other to increase his boost bar. And finally, the hub worlds. The hub worlds are beautiful. The stages are inspired from different countries here on earth. Like Greece, Italy, Africa, Antarctica, China, Saudi Arabia  and tropical islands. There are medals in hub worlds as well. They are more1 slow than stages. Here you can chat to the locals and buy stuff from the shop.

The game is split into two main parts, night and day, which most people already know. The day sections feature our favorite super sonic hedgehog, in one of his most enjoyable outings yet. The countdown starts at the beginning of the stage, Sonic yells \"GO!\" and you are sent screaming through the level. The controls are flawless, the framerate rarely dips, and for the first time in years the camera is amazing. The drift mechanic and the speed boost are welcomed additions. Drift lets you skid around corners at high speeds and speed boost (my personal favorite) makes you go crazy fast and is terrific fun. The second these stages started I got a huge smile on my face and I began to remember what a good Sonic game was all about. When the night stages started, however, my smile slowly faded. In night stages you play as a slow werehog, which isnt nearly as fun as Sonic, but...it\'s not that bad. Compared to the day stages, yes, they are slow, clunky, and sort of repetitive. But after a while, you get used to it and it is quite fun. Overall, Sonic Unleashed is a a must-buy for any Sonic fan, and I reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a fun and exhilarating game. Lets face it, there is just something amazing about running really, really freaking fast.','Hbran456','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444485,'user',9,'Jul  1, 2013','I was one of the so-called \'Kick starter\' contributors who gave money to this project and I can honestly say that I was very surprised at the final output of the game.

No, that\'s not going to be the ENTIRE review. But let me explain why. Firstly, the day stages. Every review I\'ve seen praises these stages greatly, since they are reminicent of the good old 90\'s Sonic games. Addtionaly, Griffith\'s voice has improved. Massively. As does Amy Palant\'s Tails voice. Now, he sounds like a boy. FINALLY. Now, the night stages, the biggest downside. According to most. The night stages are great. Yes, they are repetitve and yes, can be annoying. But there is a ton of ways you can complete the stage. Trying out new combos, finding stuff, and all that jazz. Also, Chip. Another downer. But, actually, on the 360 version, you rarely hear him. Not that it\'s a good thing. Chip is a great addition. All in all, Sonic Unleashed shows one thing.

Still, both forms of Sonic are fun to play as in their own way. The hubs are back, but don\'t interfere with the gameplay, but rather, simply provide extra optional missions and shops to boost the replay value. They\'re linear this time and straight-forward, so Sonic won\'t get lost and it\'s easy to find your way out of there when you get sick of it.

I always find it funny if you don\'t innovate you hear the series is getting stale and hasn\'t innovated, and then when you do it the same fans are all upset lol. Much like spy hunter this is a great innovation that works and carries on with the main theme of the series. All the classic stuff is there plus some, as you should expect as gaming goes up in computing power each generation. Games like this however are my least favourite, and induce what I call the game zombie state where you are just sitting in a chair brainlessly becoming numb just wasting time. For many that\'s what they want in games but I go for at least some brainpower. So this game for me is much better than old sonic. Unfortunately the game is still pretty shallow and other games focus on the dynamics better. That said this is a pretty decent offering. I found the graphics pretty decent and the game had some story to give you enough repetitivity (zombie numbness) breaks. If you had to be stuck with this as your only game this could keep you entertained for a long time although the game is pretty shallow. I guess this point brings me to the rating, E for everyone, no matter your age I do think this is a game anyone can pick up and play and enjoy on some level whereas classic sonics were more suited to a niche crowd.','aspentitan','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444515,'user',10,'Jul  5, 2013','Love Leisure Suit Larry.

Plot: In an ambush on Eggman\'s space armada, Eggman tricks Sonic into his energy absorbing trap and drains the energy out of the 7 Chaos Emeralds to fuel his weapon. This weapon fires upon the Earth causing a re-awakening Dark Gaia to spread out onto the Earth causing it to divide into 7 pieces dettached pieces. This also causes Sonic to transform into a Werehog with advanced combat skills, and highly extendable arms. Upon Sonics ejection back to Earth, he lands in the continent of Apotos and meets a small creature he calls Chip who has lost his memory but has a passion for food. Sonic realizes that during the daytime he will transform back into a Hedgehog, but during the night he will transform back into a Werehog. After saving Tails, he gives Sonic the ability to travel to broken continents via his airplane, Tornado 1. After saving Proffesor Pickle, they learn that if they bring the 7 drained Chaos Emeralds to the 7 temples of Gaia then they can restore power to each Emerald and put each continent back onto the Earth\'s core. Day stages: In Sonic\'s hedgehog form, he can run at super sonic speeds which are unbelievably fast but satisfying in the least, but these stages only last a few minutes and even then are hard to manuver but are part of the Sonic experience. Night stages: In Sonic\'s Werehog form speed isn\'t the gameplay theme but a combat platformer in which button combos must be mastered and stages drag on. The Medal problem: Sun and Moon Medals must be obtained in order to unlock stages that require a certain quantity of them which make the game frusterating when you can\'t proceed due to lack of Medal\'s. Opinion: Hedgehog stages are revolutionary but Werehog stages make up the majority of the game which do not properly represent Sonic\'s legacy. Because of the Medal system the game becomes very annoying when you cannot procede due to such stupidity. The idea of levels built off of real world locations is very fresh and showcases locales. Running across The Great Wall of China at super sonic speed is satisfying as well as grinding rails that circle Big Ben. If you are a Sonic fan I would try this game as well as if you are a gamer who is into travelling this is a nice one to try.','PulseEnder','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444533,'user',9,'Jun 29, 2013','Having played all Leisure Suit Larry games, including the original text parser, and the \"Lovage\" ones,','Dutchtica','ea760d3d3abce813f25f9ee63a452b17d542aac9ecf512ee97715fa3f69c168c'),(444534,'meta',58,'Jul 23, 2013','Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is a shameless game, but, alas, not in the sense that you’ve been expecting.','Riot Pixels','ea760d3d3abce813f25f9ee63a452b17d542aac9ecf512ee97715fa3f69c168c'),(444535,'meta',58,'Jul  4, 2013','Quotation forthcoming.','GameStar','ea760d3d3abce813f25f9ee63a452b17d542aac9ecf512ee97715fa3f69c168c'),(444536,'meta',56,'Jun 27, 2013','I\'m not saying that the game is a lost cause; it does have a few enjoyable moments, and N-Fusion did an amazing job bringing Leisure Suit Larry into the modern era.

Sonic really should take another daring crack like this game did. The game was fun and those who deny it are kidding themselves. While it is true that the Where hog levels were not as good as the Day stages, they were still quite fun in its own right. Me and my brother played in cooperative craze trying to beat this. He played the Where hog and me the original Sonic since I wasn\'t as good as he was in the Night stages. The Day stages are fast paced and fun with platforming in the mix. This new concept in the 3D Sonic formula really drove you into playing for those stages again. The key in these stages was to go really fast, but not get carried away in it as well. Sonic games have always challenged your restraint in speed as the trick to playing cleanly through a stage and it sure doesn\'t stop in this game either. The only problem is that Sonic is a little slippery to control at times. The Night stages, contrary to popular opinion, were really not that bad. They weren\'t as fun as the Day stages, but they were fun in their own way and really helped hit home in the atmosphere this game was playing out towards. The only flaw in this plan was that there were too many Night stages to play through. This is really dissapointing because a balance would have really made this game much better than it already is and frankly, it would make me more inclined to play through it again. The story is decent, but its presentaion is the biggest victory over it. Its saving the world from Eggman again, but it really feels like that final battle that you have to keep persevering to finally prevail in the end. The scope of this game makes you really feel like your where you are. In the Arabian area, Italian town, Tropical Island, a bustling city, etc. The music is really where I must give props for. SEGA truly had outdone themselves in an original soundtrack in this game. Its diverse and high spirited, with different cultures added into the mix. The orchestration and jazz band are truly welcome in SEGA music as this is among their best soundtracks. It really brings the adventurous feeling of traveling from country to country, saving the world, meeting new people, etc. One of my biggest gripes about this game is the voice acting. Jason does his best performance as Sonic, but everyone can\'t be said the same way. Chip\'s character was also a bit annoying, but still memorable and he did grow on me after a while. Its not the best Sonic game ever, but its still definately an underrated game in the franchise, easily worth the buy, especially the 15 dollars its on sale for these days. If you want the best version of this game I highly suggest getting the Xbox version. Don\'t pass this game up if your interested.','SuperSkyler64','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444540,'user',6,'Aug  3, 2013','Gameplay-6: The Controls are terrible, during the night they\'re somewhat tolerable but during the day he moves so fast you can barely control him, and as he collects rings (which he needs to stay alive) he gets even faster, making the controls even worse.

Honestly better than SA2. Yes I just said that. But there were barely any times that I had to rage quit Sonic Unleashed. I have turned off and almost thrown the controller in a fit of rage several times during adventure 2 and not because of Sonic and Shadow. The boost mechanic was an amazing addition to Sonic\'s 3D gameplay. The sense of speed in this game is absolutely stunning and I have an absolute blast during the daytime stages. The werehog is not a terrible thing. Honestly I actually enjoy some of the werehog stages. Except for chun nan at night. Those wizards and pole sections can shove a telephone pole up their butts. But the combat is truly enjoyable with more combos to unlock and many different methods of defeating enemies and there is something extremely satisfying about picking up an enemy and using said enemy to smack another enemy with and kill them that way. Also its funny when sonic slams them on the ground repeatedly. One major critique that I need to address is the need to hunt for sun and moon medals in order to progress throughout the story. In the nighttime stages this is no problem. During the day, however, Sonic is blazing past these things at extremely high speeds. But other than these problems This game is a truly underrated Sonic game that deserves more good rep than bad. Any of the bad reviews are essentially people who just don\'t like the werehog stages and can\'t look past that at the rest of the game.','LOCOMMANDER','55478d838a846fd14c98e6cb360df9952f7ecc893722122d80bb20c38e9da3a2'),(444615,'user',10,'Jul  6, 2013','Oh Larry, how I missed you!','DixonHill','ea760d3d3abce813f25f9ee63a452b17d542aac9ecf512ee97715fa3f69c168c'),(444616,'user',7,'Jun 29, 2013','When I saw the kickstarter I was a little apprehensive.

It\'s just a pity that some of the animations could\'ve been better not to mention gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag: the game does contain some fresh new puzzles (to keep the fans on their toes) but it also has some old-fashioned grind you\'ll have to overcome too. If you\'re a fan of Leisure Suit Larry, you probably already have this game and nothing more needs to be said. If you\'re an adventure game fan that never really played the 1987 or 1991 versions of Leisure Suit Larry, but curious as to what they\'re about, I\'d recommend you give this one a shot. Otherwise, you may want to reconsider checking it out as there\'s some worthy competition in the adventure gaming sphere nowadays.
