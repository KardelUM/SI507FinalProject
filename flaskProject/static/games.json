Her heart had been racing since the moment she heard Lillet had been invited to enroll into a Magic Academy where only talented youths were personally sought out by the greatest wizards. The school was lead by the famous wizard, Gammel Dore, who had once defeated the Archmage. And the campus on which they study, the Silver Star tower, was once the destroyed Archmage's castle.
